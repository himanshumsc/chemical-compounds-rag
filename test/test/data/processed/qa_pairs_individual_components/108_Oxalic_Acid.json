      "question": "Explain how the synthesis of oxalic acid by Friedrich Wöhler contributed to the development of chemistry.",
      "answer": "Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of oxalic acid entirely from inorganic materials was pivotal in disproving the Vitalistic Theory of chemistry. This theory claimed that compounds found in living organisms could only be produced by supernatural means. Wöhler's work demonstrated that such compounds could be created through human actions, advancing the understanding of organic chemistry.",
