      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image represents carbon dioxide (CO₂). It consists of one carbon atom (black) and two oxygen atoms (red), with double bonds shown as gray sticks. Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas at room temperature and is a significant greenhouse gas. It is produced naturally through processes like respiration, fermentation, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Industrially, it's obtained from reactions involving calcium carbonate or as a by-product in processes like the Haber-Bosch process.",

      "question": "Explain the role of carbon dioxide in the carbonation of beverages and its effects on taste and preservation.",
      "answer": "Carbon dioxide is used in the carbonation of beverages to add a zesty taste and help preserve the drink. When carbon dioxide is dissolved in water, it creates carbonated beverages that have a sparkling and refreshing quality. This process can occur naturally, as in the fermentation of sugars in beers and sparkling wines, or artificially, where carbon dioxide is added to nearly all other carbonated drinks.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the significance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and its properties.",
      "answer": "Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) is a form of carbon dioxide that, under specific conditions of temperature and pressure, behaves as both a liquid and a gas. This unique property makes SC-CO2 a highly efficient solvent with no environmental disadvantages. Its ability to act as both a liquid and gas simultaneously is valuable in various industrial processes, particularly where an environmentally friendly solvent is required.",
