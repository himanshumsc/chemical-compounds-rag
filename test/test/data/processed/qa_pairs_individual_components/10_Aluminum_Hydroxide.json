      "question": "Explain how aluminum hydroxide is used in medical applications and describe its effectiveness.",
      "answer": "Aluminum hydroxide is used in medical applications as an antacid. It is effective because it is a base that reacts with stomach acid, specifically hydrochloric acid (HCl), to alleviate symptoms such as heartburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis. It is also used for long-term treatment of peptic ulcers, which are open sores in the stomach lining or the first part of the small intestine.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the industrial production process of aluminum hydroxide from bauxite, including the role of sodium hydroxide.",
      "answer": "Aluminum hydroxide is industrially produced by treating bauxite with a hot, concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide precipitates out as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipitate. This precipitate can be dried to form a white powder. Additionally, aluminum hydroxide can be precipitated by passing carbon dioxide gas through the solution. This production process is crucial for extracting aluminum hydroxide from bauxite, an important raw material.",
