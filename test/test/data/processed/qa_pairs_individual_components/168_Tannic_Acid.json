      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is tannic acid. It is a type of tannin, which is a class of compounds known for their ability to precipitate proteins. Tannic acid is used primarily in the tanning process, where it helps convert raw animal hides into leather by transforming proteins to resist decomposition. Additionally, it is used for staining wood, dyeing cloth, and treating minor cuts and wounds. The molecular structure includes red atoms representing oxygen, black atoms representing carbon, and white atoms representing hydrogen.",

      "question": "Explain the structural modification of glucose that leads to the formation of tannic acid.",
      "answer": "Tannic acid is a derivative of the simple sugar glucose (C6H12O6). In tannic acid, five hydroxyl groups (-OH) present in glucose are replaced by large complex side chains known as digalloyl groups, resulting in the compound's unique structure.",
