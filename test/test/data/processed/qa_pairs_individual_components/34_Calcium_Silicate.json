    {
      "question": "Explain why calcium silicate does not have a boiling point and describe its solubility properties.",
      "answer": "Calcium silicate does not have a boiling point because it is an inorganic salt that decomposes before it could transition from a liquid to a gas state. In terms of solubility, calcium silicate is insoluble in water and most other common solvents, meaning it does not dissolve easily in these substances.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing calcium silicate for commercial applications and state why synthetic preparation might be preferred over extraction from natural sources.",
      "answer": "Calcium silicate is typically synthesized by adding lime (calcium oxide, CaO) to diatomaceous earth, which provides the required silicon dioxide (SiO2). This process is preferred for commercial applications because it ensures the purity of the calcium silicate, which might not be guaranteed when extracting the compound from natural sources.",
