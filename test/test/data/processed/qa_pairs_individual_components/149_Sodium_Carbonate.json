      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). In the structure, red atoms are oxygen, the black atom is carbon, and turquoise atoms are sodium. Sodium carbonate is a white, water-soluble salt with alkaline properties. It is commonly used in the manufacture of glass, detergents, and other industrial products. Historically, it was significant in ancient Egyptian mummification processes and as a component of natron. Sodium carbonate is also known as soda ash.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the solubility characteristics of sodium carbonate in different solvents.",
      "answer": "Sodium carbonate is soluble in water, which means it can dissolve in water to form a solution. However, it is insoluble in ethyl alcohol, indicating that it does not dissolve in this solvent.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Discuss the significance of sodium carbonate's hygroscopic nature and its implications for storage.",
      "answer": "Sodium carbonate is hygroscopic, meaning it tends to absorb moisture from the air. This property affects how the compound should be stored; it needs to be kept in airtight containers to prevent it from absorbing moisture, which could alter its physical state and potentially its reactivity.",
