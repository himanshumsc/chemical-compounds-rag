      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Its molecular structure consists of repeating units of vinyl chloride, where each unit includes carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine atoms. PVC is a versatile plastic known for its durability, chemical resistance, and low cost. It is widely used in construction, plumbing, and electrical insulation. PVC can be rigid or flexible, depending on the addition of plasticizers, making it suitable for a variety of applications.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why Polyvinyl Chloride does not have a boiling point and describe its decomposition behavior.",
      "answer": "Polyvinyl Chloride does not have a boiling point because it is a solid polymer and does not vaporize before decomposing. It decomposes at a temperature of 148°C (298°F), indicating that it breaks down into other substances at this temperature rather than transitioning to a gaseous state.",
