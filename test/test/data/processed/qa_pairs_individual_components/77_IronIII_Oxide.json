      "question": "Explain the ferromagnetic property of Iron(III) oxide as mentioned in the compound information.",
      "answer": "Iron(III) oxide is described as ferromagnetic, which means it has the ability to become highly magnetic and retain its magnetism. This property is significant because it indicates that Iron(III) oxide can be magnetized, making it useful in various magnetic applications.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process of how Iron(III) oxide is reduced to iron metal in a blast furnace.",
      "answer": "In a blast furnace, Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is reduced to iron metal by reacting it with carbon. The process involves a blast of air and heat, which causes the oxygen from the air to react with carbon to create carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide then reacts with Iron(III) oxide to produce liquid iron metal and carbon dioxide.",
