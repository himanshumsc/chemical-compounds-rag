      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is calcium oxide (CaO). In the molecular structure diagram, the red atom represents oxygen, and the green atom represents calcium, with the gray stick indicating a double bond.\n\nKey properties of calcium oxide include:\n\n1. **Production**: Made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO₃), which releases carbon dioxide (CO₂) and leaves calcium oxide.\n\n2. **Uses**: Primarily used in metallurgy, especially in steel production, where it helps remove impurities. It is also used in pollution control devices to clean emissions.\n\n3. **Hazards**: Calcium...",

      "question": "Explain how calcium oxide reacts with water and the implications of this reaction.",
      "answer": "Calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), releasing significant amounts of heat in the process. This exothermic reaction makes calcium oxide strongly caustic, meaning it can cause severe skin and eye irritation upon contact.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the role of calcium oxide in metallurgy and its chemical function during the steel-making process.",
      "answer": "In metallurgy, particularly in steel production, calcium oxide is added to the furnace to react with impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, and silica present in the molten steel mixture. The reaction forms a nonmetallic waste product called slag, which separates from the steel. This process helps purify the steel by removing unwanted impurities, and about 40% of calcium oxide produced in the United States is used for this purpose.",
