      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of magnesium oxide (MgO). The black atom represents magnesium, and the red atom represents oxygen, with the stick indicating a double bond.\n\nKey properties of magnesium oxide include:\n\n- High melting point, making it suitable for use in refractory materials.\n- Chemically inert when dead-burned, useful in industrial applications like cement kilns.\n- Retains some reactivity when hard-burned, applicable in fertilizers and animal feed.\n- Dense and inert when fused, useful in high-temperature applications.",

      "question": "Describe the different methods used to prepare Magnesium Oxide and how they affect its chemical reactivity.",
      "answer": "Magnesium Oxide can be prepared using several methods: Dead-burning involves heating magnesium hydroxide or carbonate to 1,500°C to 2,000°C, producing a largely unreactive product. Hard-burning heats them to 1,000°C to 1,500°C, retaining some reactivity. Light-burning is done at 700°C to 1,000°C, resulting in a product with more reactivity. Fusion involves heating beyond 2,650°C to produce a dense, inert product.",

    {
      "question": "How are the specific forms of Magnesium Oxide used in various industries, and what are the hazards associated with its use?",
      "answer": "Dead-burned Magnesium Oxide is used as refractory brick in cement kilns, furnaces, and crucibles, and in steel manufacturing equipment. Hard-burned Magnesium Oxide is used in fertilizer and animal feed production, and in extracting uranium oxide. While the compound itself is generally safe, the production processes involve high temperatures that can present hazards if not managed properly.",
