      "question": "Explain the role of Sodium Thiosulfate as an antichlor in industrial applications.",
      "answer": "Sodium Thiosulfate is used as an antichlor, which means it reacts with and neutralizes excess chlorine used in industrial processes. In the production of pulp, paper, and textiles, chlorine is used to bleach these materials. After the bleaching process, Sodium Thiosulfate is added to remove any remaining chlorine from the reaction vat, ensuring that the final product is free of chlorine residues. The antichlor is then washed away with water.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction involved in the direct production of Sodium Thiosulfate from sodium sulfite.",
      "answer": "Sodium Thiosulfate can be produced directly by adding powdered sulfur to a solution of sodium sulfite and heating the reactants. The chemical reaction is as follows: Na2SO3 + S → Na2S2O3. In this reaction, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) reacts with sulfur (S) to form Sodium Thiosulfate (Na2S2O3).",
