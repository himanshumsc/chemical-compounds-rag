    {
      "question": "Why is polypropylene considered a thermoplastic polymer, and how does this property affect its usability?",
      "answer": "Polypropylene is considered a thermoplastic polymer because it can be repeatedly heated and cooled, transitioning from a solid to a liquid and back again. This property allows it to be molded and extruded into various shapes and forms, making it versatile for applications such as fibers, fabrics, and containers.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the role of catalysts in the production of crystalline polypropylene and name one type of catalyst used.",
      "answer": "In the production of crystalline polypropylene, catalysts are crucial for controlling the polymerization process to ensure that all methyl groups extend in the same direction from the main chain, creating a crystalline structure with desirable properties. Titanium chloride, a metal halide, is one type of catalyst used to achieve this effect. More recently, metallocenes have also been used as efficient catalysts for producing crystalline polypropylene.",
