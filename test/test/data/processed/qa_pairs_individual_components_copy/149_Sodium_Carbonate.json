    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the solubility characteristics of sodium carbonate in different solvents.",
      "answer": "Sodium carbonate is soluble in water, which means it can dissolve in water to form a solution. However, it is insoluble in ethyl alcohol, indicating that it does not dissolve in this solvent.",

      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Discuss the significance of sodium carbonate's hygroscopic nature and its implications for storage.",
      "answer": "Sodium carbonate is hygroscopic, meaning it tends to absorb moisture from the air. This property affects how the compound should be stored; it needs to be kept in airtight containers to prevent it from absorbing moisture, which could alter its physical state and potentially its reactivity.",
