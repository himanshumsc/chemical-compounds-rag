    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the chemical reaction involved in producing Sodium Fluoride using hydrogen fluoride and sodium carbonate.",
      "answer": "Sodium Fluoride can be produced by reacting hydrogen fluoride (HF) with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The chemical equation for this reaction is: 2HF + Na2CO3 → 2NaF + H2O + CO2. In this reaction, hydrogen fluoride reacts with sodium carbonate to form sodium fluoride, water, and carbon dioxide.",
