    {
      "question": "Describe the process of producing potassium sulfate from langbeinite and potassium chloride.",
      "answer": "Potassium sulfate can be produced from the mineral langbeinite (K2Mg2(SO4)3) by crushing and washing the mineral to separate out the double salt. This product is then treated with an aqueous solution of potassium chloride (KCl) to separate the two parts of the double salt, resulting in the formation of potassium sulfate (K2SO4) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) as by-products.",
