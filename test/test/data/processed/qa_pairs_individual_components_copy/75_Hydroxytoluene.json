      "question": "What are the chemical formulas and molecular weights of BHA and BHT?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) is C11H16O2, with a molecular weight of 180.24 g/mol. The chemical formula for Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) is C15H24O, with a molecular weight of 220.35 g/mol.",

    {
      "question": "How do BHA and BHT function as food preservatives?",
      "answer": "BHA and BHT function as food preservatives by acting as antioxidants. These compounds prevent oxygen from reacting with fats and oils, which would otherwise oxidize and become rancid, producing foul-smelling and potentially harmful products. By reacting with oxygen, BHA and BHT protect the food's fats and oils, thus extending the shelf life of food products.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing BHA and BHT, including the reactants and conditions required.",
      "answer": "BHA is synthesized through a reaction between p-methoxyphenol (CH3CH2OC6H4OH) and isobutene ((CH3)2C=CH2) or tert-butyl alcohol ((CH3)3COH) using a catalyst of silica (SiO2) or alumina (Al2O3) at temperatures around 150°C (302°F). BHT, on the other hand, is typically made by reacting p-cresol (CH3C6H4OH) with isobutene. These processes use specific catalysts and conditions to facilitate the desired chemical reactions that produce BHA and BHT.",
