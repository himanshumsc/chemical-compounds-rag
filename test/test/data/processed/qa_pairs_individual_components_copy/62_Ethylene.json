    },
    {
      "question": "Explain why Ethylene is classified as an unsaturated hydrocarbon.",
      "answer": "Ethylene is classified as an unsaturated hydrocarbon because it contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in its molecular structure. This double bond is characteristic of alkenes, which are a type of unsaturated hydrocarbon, meaning they have fewer hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon chain compared to saturated hydrocarbons, which only have single bonds.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the role of Ethylene as a plant hormone and provide an example of its historical use.",
      "answer": "Ethylene acts as a plant hormone that influences various aspects of plant growth and development, such as fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf fall. Historically, its effects were utilized by the ancient Chinese, who burned incense in closed containers to promote the ripening of pears. This practice took advantage of ethylene's natural ability to stimulate fruit ripening, long before the chemical mechanism was understood.",
