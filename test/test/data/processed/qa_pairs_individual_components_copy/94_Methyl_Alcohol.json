    {
      "question": "Explain how methyl alcohol is commercially produced.",
      "answer": "Methyl alcohol is commercially produced by reacting carbon monoxide with water at a temperature of about 250°C (480°F) and pressures of 50 to 100 atmospheres. This reaction is carried out over a mixed catalyst of copper, zinc oxide, and aluminum oxide. Although there are experimental methods involving the oxidation of simple hydrocarbons over a catalyst of molybdenum metal, they are not competitive with the traditional carbon monoxide-hydrogen process.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the environmental concerns associated with the use of methyl alcohol in producing MTBE and the impact on its demand.",
      "answer": "Methyl alcohol has been used in large quantities for the production of MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl ether), a gasoline additive aimed at improving fuel efficiency and reducing atmospheric pollutants. However, environmental concerns arose regarding MTBE's potential to contaminate soil and water. This led to a decline in its use as a gasoline additive, with several states implementing bans. Consequently, the demand for methyl alcohol for MTBE production has dropped significantly in recent years.",
