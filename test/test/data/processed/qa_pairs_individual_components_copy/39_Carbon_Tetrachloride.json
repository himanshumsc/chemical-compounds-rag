      "question": "Discuss the historical applications of Carbon Tetrachloride and the reasons for the decline in its usage.",
      "answer": "Historically, Carbon Tetrachloride was used as a dry cleaning fluid, refrigerant, industrial solvent, and in fire extinguishers. However, its use declined significantly after the mid-twentieth century due to accumulating evidence of its severe health hazards. By the 1970s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned its use in consumer products, reflecting growing concerns over its safety.",
