    {
      "question": "Explain the process of polymerization as it relates to styrene and identify the type of compounds formed as a result.",
      "answer": "Polymerization is a chemical reaction where small molecules, like styrene, react with other molecules of the same kind to produce very large molecules, usually consisting of long chains. In the case of styrene, when it polymerizes, it forms polystyrene, a clear, colorless, hard plastic.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the industrial preparation method for styrene, including the chemical reaction and conditions involved.",
      "answer": "The industrial preparation of styrene starts with the reaction between benzene (C6H6) and ethylene (CH2=CH2) to form ethylbenzene (C6H5CH2CH3). This ethylbenzene is then dehydrogenated over a catalyst of iron(III) oxides at about 600°C (1100°F). Dehydrogenation involves removing hydrogen atoms from the compound, resulting in the formation of styrene: C6H5CH2CH3 - H2 → C6H5CH=CH2.",
