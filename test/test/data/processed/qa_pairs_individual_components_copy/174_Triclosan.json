    {
      "question": "How does Triclosan exhibit its antimicrobial properties?",
      "answer": "Triclosan exhibits its antimicrobial properties by inhibiting the action of the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier-protein reductase (ENR), which is necessary for bacteria and fungi to synthesize fatty acids needed for cell membrane construction. Without the ability to manufacture cell walls, these microorganisms die. This enzyme is not present in humans, so Triclosan does not affect the human body.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe one method of synthesizing Triclosan and explain why it might be preferred in manufacturing.",
      "answer": "One method of synthesizing Triclosan involves reacting 1,4-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene (C6H3Cl2NO3) with 2,4-dichlorophenol (C6H3ClOH). This method might be preferred in manufacturing due to the straightforward availability of the starting materials and potentially fewer steps compared to other synthetic routes. This could lead to a more efficient production process.",
