      "question": "Explain why TNT is considered a relatively safe explosive to handle compared to other explosives.",
      "answer": "TNT is considered relatively safe to handle because it is insensitive to shock. This means that it does not explode easily if dropped or jarred. A detonator or blasting cap, which is a more sensitive explosive, is required to trigger an explosion. This property allows workers to handle it with less risk of accidental detonation.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss how TNT's solubility properties affect its applications and handling.",
      "answer": "TNT is insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol, ether, acetone, and benzene. These solubility properties influence its applications and handling in several ways. Being insoluble in water means that TNT does not dissolve in moist environments, which is beneficial for its stability as an explosive. Its solubility in organic solvents allows for its purification and processing during manufacturing. These properties must be considered to ensure safe handling and effective use in explosive formulations.",
