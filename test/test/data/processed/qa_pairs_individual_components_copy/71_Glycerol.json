    },
    {
      "question": "Why is glycerol classified as a trihydric alcohol, and what are its solubility properties?",
      "answer": "Glycerol is classified as a trihydric alcohol because its molecules contain three hydroxyl (-OH) groups. It is miscible with water and alcohol but insoluble in ether, benzene, and chloroform.",

      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the traditional method of producing glycerol and its significance in the soap industry.",
      "answer": "The traditional method of producing glycerol is through the saponification of fats. Fats, which are esters of glycerol and alcohols, are hydrolyzed in the presence of a catalyst, converting them into glycerol and alcohols. This process is significant in the soap industry because glycerol is obtained as a byproduct, and saponification is the usual method for soap production.",
