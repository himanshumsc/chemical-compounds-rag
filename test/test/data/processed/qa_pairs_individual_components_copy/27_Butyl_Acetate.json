      "question": "What is the molecular formula of butyl acetate and what elements does it consist of?",
      "answer": "The molecular formula of butyl acetate is C6H12O2. It consists of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) elements.",

      "question": "Explain the concept of isomers in the context of butyl acetate and list its three isomeric forms.",
      "answer": "Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural formulas and properties. Butyl acetate has three isomeric forms: n-butyl acetate, sec-butyl acetate, and tert-butyl acetate. Each isomer has a different structural arrangement despite having the same molecular formula, C6H12O2.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the industrial production process for butyl acetate and its primary uses.",
      "answer": "All three isomers of butyl acetate are produced by reacting acetic acid (CH3COOH) with the corresponding butyl alcohol (n-butyl, sec-butyl, or tert-butyl alcohol). The primary use of butyl acetate is as a solvent in the production of lacquers, paints, photographic film, resins, and various coatings. Additionally, n-butyl acetate is used as an odor enhancer in perfumes and in the synthesis of synthetic flavors, pharmaceuticals, and other organic compounds.",
