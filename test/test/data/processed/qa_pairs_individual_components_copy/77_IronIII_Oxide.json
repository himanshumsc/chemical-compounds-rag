    {
      "question": "Describe the process of how Iron(III) oxide is reduced to iron metal in a blast furnace.",
      "answer": "In a blast furnace, Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is reduced to iron metal by reacting it with carbon. The process involves a blast of air and heat, which causes the oxygen from the air to react with carbon to create carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide then reacts with Iron(III) oxide to produce liquid iron metal and carbon dioxide.",
