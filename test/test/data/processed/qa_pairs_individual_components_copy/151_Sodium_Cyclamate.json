    {
      "question": "Why is sodium cyclamate considered an organic salt, and what are its solubility characteristics?",
      "answer": "Sodium cyclamate is considered an organic salt because it contains a combination of an organic moiety (cyclohexyl group) and an ionic component (sodium and sulfamate group). It is soluble in water but insoluble in most organic solvents.",

    {
      "question": "How did the discovery of sodium cyclamate occur, and what is its primary use today?",
      "answer": "Sodium cyclamate was discovered in 1937 by Michael Sveda, a graduate student who noticed a sweet flavor on his cigarette while working on drug development. He identified the sweetness source as cyclamates. Today, sodium cyclamate is primarily used as an artificial sweetener, with a sweetening power about 30 times that of table sugar.",
