      "question": "Explain the significance of Methyl-t-butyl Ether's azeotropic mixture with water.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl Ether forms an azeotropic mixture with water, meaning that this combination of liquids boils at the same temperature and cannot be easily separated through distillation. This property indicates the presence of a constant boiling point that is lower than that of the individual components, making separation through conventional means challenging.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the historical context and environmental impact that led to the use of Methyl-t-butyl Ether as a gasoline additive.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl Ether (MTBE) was first synthesized in the 1960s as an additive to increase the octane number of gasoline, serving as a replacement for tetraethyl lead (Pb(C2H5)4), which was phased out due to its harmful environmental and health effects. The removal of lead from gasoline began in 1973 and was largely completed by 1996. In 1990, MTBE found a new application following U.S. legislation that required gasoline to burn more cleanly, thus reducing air pollution and improving environmental quality.",
