      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the chemical compound potassium fluoride (KF). In the molecular structure, the silver atom represents potassium, and the yellow atom represents fluorine.\n\n**Key Properties:**\n- **Uses:** It is used as a fluoridating agent in organic chemical preparation and in metallurgy as a flux for metal finishing and coatings.\n- **Hazards:** It is crucial in manufacturing certain chemical weapons, thus export is controlled.\n- **Fun Fact:** In France, it is added to table salt to prevent dental cavities.",

      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing Potassium Fluoride from potassium carbonate and hydrofluoric acid.",
      "answer": "Potassium fluoride (KF) can be synthesized from potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and hydrofluoric acid (H2F2) through a two-step process. In the first step, potassium carbonate is dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, resulting in the formation of potassium bifluoride (KHF2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) as follows:\n\nK2CO3 + 2H2F2 → 2KHF2 + CO2 + H2O.\n\nIn the second step, the potassium bifluoride (KHF2) is heated to produce potassium fluoride (KF) and hydrogen fluoride (HF):\n\nKHF2 → KF + HF.\n\nThe potassium fluoride formed is then dried and crystallized or converted to powder form.",
