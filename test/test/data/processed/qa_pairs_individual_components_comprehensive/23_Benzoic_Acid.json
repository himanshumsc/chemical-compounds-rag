      "question": "Explain how benzoic acid can be produced from natural sources and its occurrence in nature.",
      "answer": "Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants, including most types of berries and gum benzoin, a plant found in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. Gum benzoin can contain up to 20% benzoic acid. Additionally, benzoic acid is excreted by most animals (excluding fowl) as hippuric acid. It can be prepared from natural sources such as gum benzoin, which contains high concentrations of the compound.",
