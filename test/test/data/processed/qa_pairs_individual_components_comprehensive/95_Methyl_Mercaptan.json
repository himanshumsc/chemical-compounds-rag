      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is methyl mercaptan. Its molecular structure includes white atoms representing hydrogen, a black atom for carbon, and a yellow atom for sulfur. Methyl mercaptan is primarily used in the synthesis of organic compounds like pesticides, fungicides, and the amino acid methionine. It is also used as an odorant to add a noticeable smell to otherwise odorless gases for safety purposes. Despite being natural, it is hazardous, potentially irritating the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs upon inhalation.",

      "question": "Explain the primary use of Methyl Mercaptan and why it is important for safety in certain applications.",
      "answer": "Methyl mercaptan's primary use is in the synthesis of other organic compounds, including pesticides, fungicides, jet fuel components, plastics, and the amino acid methionine, which is a building block for proteins. Additionally, methyl mercaptan is used as an odorant, a substance with a noticeable and usually offensive odor, added to odorless gases like propane and natural gas for safety purposes. This is important because it ensures that consumers are alerted to gas leaks through the distinctive odor, allowing them to address leaks before they lead to fires or explosions.",

      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction process used to synthesize Methyl Mercaptan.",
      "answer": "Methyl mercaptan is synthesized through the direct reaction between methanol (methyl alcohol; CH3OH) and hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). During this process, the hydroxyl group (-OH) from methanol combines with one hydrogen atom from hydrogen sulfide to form water. This reaction leaves methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) as the major product.",
