      "question": "Explain why calcium silicate does not have a boiling point and describe its solubility properties.",
      "answer": "Calcium silicate does not have a boiling point because it is an inorganic salt that exists in a solid state and does not transition to a gaseous phase under normal conditions. Instead, it decomposes or reacts chemically at high temperatures rather than boiling. As specified in the provided context, the boiling point is noted as \"not applicable.\"\n\nRegarding its solubility properties, calcium silicate is insoluble in water and most other common solvents. This is a key characteristic of the compound, making it suitable for applications where water resistance is important, such as in building materials like cement and tiles. The insolubility also contributes to its use as a filler in paper and plastics, where it provides structural benefits without dissolving.",

      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing calcium silicate for commercial applications and state why synthetic preparation might be preferred over extraction from natural sources.",
      "answer": "Calcium silicate is typically synthesized for commercial applications to ensure the purity required for most uses. The synthetic preparation process involves adding lime (calcium oxide, CaO) to diatomaceous earth, which is composed of fossilized remains of diatoms and provides silicon dioxide (SiO2). This method is preferred over extraction from natural sources because, despite calcium silicate's abundance in rocks and minerals, synthesizing the compound allows for controlled conditions and purity essential for various industrial uses.",
