      "question": "Explain the difference between the two isomeric forms of butane.",
      "answer": "Butane exists in two isomeric forms, both having the same molecular formula, C4H10, but differing in their structural arrangements. In the 'normal' or 'n-butane' isomer, the four carbon atoms are arranged in a continuous chain. In contrast, the 'iso-butane' isomer has three carbon atoms arranged in a continuous chain, with the fourth carbon atom attached to the middle atom in that chain. These structural differences result in variations in physical and chemical properties, even though the molecular formula remains the same.",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility and state of butane, and its implications for its use as a fuel.",
      "answer": "Butane (C4H10) is a colorless gas that is highly flammable and explosive, making it suitable for use as a fuel. It is a saturated hydrocarbon, specifically an alkane, and exists in two isomeric forms: n-butane and iso-butane. Butane has a molecular weight of 58.12 g/mol, a melting point of -138.3°C (-216.9°F), and a boiling point of -0.5°C (31°F), which categorizes it as a gas under standard conditions.\n\nIn terms of solubility, butane is slightly soluble in water but soluble in ethyl alcohol, ether, and chloroform. This limited solubility in water affects its dispersion and combustion in aqueous environments but does not hinder its effectiveness as a fuel. Its solubility in organic solvents like ethyl alcohol and ether can be advantageous in industrial applications where butane is mixed with other chemicals for various processes.\n\nThe high flammability of butane, combined with its gaseous state at room temperature, makes it an efficient fuel source, particularly for portable applications such as lighters and camping stoves. Its ability to easily mix with air and combust efficiently contributes to its widespread use. Additionally, butane is often used as a propellant in spray products and as a chemical intermediary in the production of other substances. Its presence in natural gas and petroleum, albeit in small amounts, allows for its extraction and use in these applications.",
