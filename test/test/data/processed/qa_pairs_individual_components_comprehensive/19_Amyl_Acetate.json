      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is amyl acetate. It is characterized by the following properties:\n\n- **Composition**: Made up of carbon (black atoms), hydrogen (white atoms), and oxygen (red atoms). The gray stick indicates a double bond.\n\n- **Synthesis**: Produced by reacting acetic acid (\\(HC_2H_3O_2\\)) with amyl alcohol (\\(C_5H_{11}OH\\)) in the presence of sulfuric acid (\\(H_2SO_4\\)) as a catalyst.\n\n- **Uses**: Commonly used as a flavoring agent due to its fruity, banana-like odor. It's used in products like chewing gum and to mask unpleasant odors.\n\n- **Hazards**: Exposure...",

      "question": "Describe the process by which Amyl Acetate is industrially produced.",
      "answer": "Amyl acetate is industrially produced by adding acetic acid (HC2H3O2) to amyl alcohol (C5H11OH) with a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a catalyst. The specific type of amyl acetate produced depends on the specific amyl alcohol used in the reaction. After the reaction, the product is separated from the reaction mixture by boiling the liquid mixture. This process is similar to the method used in a high school or college chemistry laboratory.",

      "question": "Explain why different isomers of Amyl Acetate have varying boiling points and provide their values.",
      "answer": "Different isomers of amyl acetate have varying boiling points because they possess the same molecular formula but different structural formulas, which result in different chemical and physical properties. The boiling points provided for the three major isomers are as follows: normal (n-amyl) acetate has a boiling point of 149.2°C (300.6°F), secondary (sec-amyl) acetate has a boiling point of 142.0°C (287.6°F), and isoamyl (3-methyl-1-butyl) acetate has a boiling point of 140.0°C (284.0°F). The structural differences among these isomers influence intermolecular forces, thus affecting their boiling points.",
