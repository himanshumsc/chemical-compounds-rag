      "question": "Explain how Potassium Bitartrate is produced and name one of its historical uses.",
      "answer": "Potassium bitartrate is produced by treating wine lees (the solid material left after grapes have been crushed to make wine) with hot water, which dissolves the potassium bitartrate. The hot solution is then allowed to evaporate, and as potassium bitartrate crystals form, they are removed and purified.\n\nOne of its historical uses was by ancient people in a wide range of household applications, including cooking and baking.",
