      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of toluene. Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C₇H₈. It consists of a benzene ring (a hexagon of carbon atoms with alternating double bonds) with a single methyl group (CH₃) attached. Key properties of toluene include being a clear, colorless liquid with a distinct smell, high solvency, and flammability. It's commonly used as an industrial solvent and in the production of chemicals like benzene and xylene.",

      "question": "Describe the process by which toluene is extracted from petroleum.",
      "answer": "Toluene is extracted from petroleum through a process known as catalytic reforming. This involves heating hydrocarbons in petroleum, often in the presence of a catalyst, to alter their molecular composition. The naphtha segment of petroleum, which is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons with boiling points between approximately 50°C and 200°C, is subjected to this process. During catalytic reforming, toluene is separated from other hydrocarbons by using a solvent such as sulfolane or tetraethylene glycol. Toluene dissolves in these solvents, while most other hydrocarbons do not, allowing for its extraction. Additionally, toluene can also be obtained from coal tar oil, a liquid remaining when soft coal is heated in the absence of air to produce coke.",

      "question": "What are the major industrial applications of toluene and its role in the production of other chemicals?",
      "answer": "Toluene is a major industrial compound with several key applications. It is commonly used as a solvent in paints, coatings, gums, oils, rubber products, adhesives, and plastics due to its ability to dissolve various substances. Toluene is also used as a blending agent in aviation fuels and other gasoline mixtures with high-octane ratings.\n\nIn the chemical industry, toluene serves as a precursor for the production of other chemicals. About half of the toluene produced is used to make benzene, while around 20% is used to produce xylene. Additionally, toluene is used to manufacture toluene diisocyanate, which is crucial for producing polyurethane foams and artificial rubber products. A smaller but significant application of toluene is in the production of trinitrotoluene (TNT), an explosive. TNT is valued for its stability, detonating only when shocked or heated above 230°C, and releasing large amounts of energy upon explosion.\n\nToluene is extracted from petroleum through catalytic reforming, where it is separated from other hydrocarbons using solvents like sulfolane or tetraethylene glycol. This process highlights its role in the petrochemical industry as an important raw material.",
