      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is amyl nitrite. It consists of carbon (black spheres), hydrogen (white spheres), oxygen (red spheres), and nitrogen (blue sphere). Amyl nitrite is used medically to treat angina by causing blood vessels to expand, improving blood flow and reducing chest pain. It also has applications in treating poisoning by hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide. Additionally, it is used in perfumes and as a room deodorizer due to its ability to produce relaxing effects.",

      "question": "Why is isoamyl nitrite considered unstable, and what are its effects when used medically?",
      "answer": "Isoamyl nitrite is considered unstable because it breaks down when exposed to air, light, or water. Medically, it is used as a vasodilator to treat pain from angina, which occurs due to the constriction of blood vessels. By causing the blood vessels to relax and expand, it eases blood flow and reduces chest pain. Additionally, it is used by emergency medical providers to treat poisoning by hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide gas. In the body, it converts to methemoglobin, which binds to these toxic gases, reducing their harmful effects.",

      "question": "Describe the synthesis method of isoamyl nitrite, and explain its use in emergency medical situations.",
      "answer": "Isoamyl nitrite is synthesized through a reaction of isoamyl alcohol and nitrous acid. The usual preparation involves generating gaseous nitrous acid by combining starch with concentrated nitric acid. This gas is then passed through warm isoamyl alcohol. Alternatively, isoamyl nitrite can be produced by distilling a mixture of potassium nitrite, isoamyl alcohol, and sulfuric acid.\n\nIn emergency medical situations, amyl nitrites, including isoamyl nitrite, are used to treat pain from angina, caused by constricted blood vessels. They act as vasodilators, relaxing and expanding blood vessels to improve blood flow and reduce chest pain. Amyl nitrites are also used by emergency medical providers to treat poisoning from hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide gas. In the body, they convert to methemoglobin, which binds to these toxic substances, reducing their harmful effects.",
