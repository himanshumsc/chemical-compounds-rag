      "question": "Explain how the synthesis of oxalic acid by Friedrich Wöhler contributed to the development of chemistry.",
      "answer": "Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of oxalic acid was significant in the development of chemistry because it disproved the Vitalistic Theory. This theory posited that compounds found in living organisms could only be produced by supernatural means and not by human action. Wöhler's ability to synthesize oxalic acid entirely from inorganic materials demonstrated that organic compounds could be artificially created in a laboratory setting, challenging the idea that a special \"vital force\" was necessary for the synthesis of organic substances. This marked a pivotal moment in chemistry, as it laid the groundwork for the field of organic chemistry and the understanding that organic compounds could be synthesized from inorganic materials.",
