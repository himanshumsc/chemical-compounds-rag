      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is of fructose. Fructose is a simple sugar, or monosaccharide, with the chemical formula C₆H₁₂O₆. It is characterized by its sweetness and is commonly found in fruits, honey, and root vegetables. Fructose is often used in food products as a sweetener and preservative, notably in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). It is highly soluble in water and has a key role in various metabolic pathways. However, excessive consumption can lead to health issues like obesity and insulin resistance.",

      "question": "Explain the structural difference between fructose and sucrose.",
      "answer": "Fructose and sucrose differ structurally in the number of sugar rings they contain. Fructose is a monosaccharide, meaning it has a single sugar ring. It is composed of five of six carbon atoms arranged in a ring, with hydrogen atoms and hydroxy (-OH) groups attached, forming a carbohydrate with the formula C6H12O6. In contrast, sucrose is a disaccharide, which means it consists of two sugar rings. This fundamental structural difference distinguishes fructose from sucrose in terms of molecular composition and categorization as a sugar.",

      "question": "Describe the commercial production process of fructose.",
      "answer": "Fructose is commercially produced by the hydrolysis of beet sugar or inulin, a polysaccharide found in the roots of plants such as dahlias, Jerusalem artichokes, and chicory. Hydrolysis is a process that breaks down materials into simpler elements by reacting them with water. After hydrolysis, the mixture is treated with lime (calcium oxide; CaO) to extract the fructose. The fructose is then refined by removing any impurities left from the preparation process.",
