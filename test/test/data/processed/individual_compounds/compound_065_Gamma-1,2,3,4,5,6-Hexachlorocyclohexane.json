The wood and timber industries also\nuse the product to protect trees from insects that attack\nthem. In some places, g-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane\nis used as a spray to control the spread of mosquitoes. Veter-\ninarians sometimes use the compound to treat or prevent\nfleas and other external parasites on animals. Gamma-\n1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane is also a major ingredient\nof products used to treat head lice, scabies, and similar pests\nthat infest body hair.\nGamma-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane is a member of\nthe family of compounds known as the organochlorides,\norganic compounds that include one or more atom of chlor-\nine in their molecular structure. The family also includes a\nnumber of other well-known products, such as DDT, dieldrin,\naldrin, endrin, dinoseb, and chlordane. These compounds kill\npests by attacking and incapacitating their nervous systems.\nUnfortunately, they have somewhat similar effects on the\nnervous systems of higher animals, including humans. Many\nof these organochlorides have been banned in commercial\napplications and many nations around the world.\nThe status of g-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane is still\na matter of some controversy. It is banned for medicinal uses\nin many countries of the world, including Bangladesh, Belize,\nBolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chad, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt,\nFinland, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia,\nJapan, Kuwait, Mozambique, New Zealand, The Netherlands,\nNicaragua,\nParaguay,\nthe\nRepublic\nof\nKorea,\nSingapore,\nSweden, Taiwan, and Yemen.

The product has also been banned\nfor some or all agriculture applications in more than 50 nations.\nGamma-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane poses a health\nhazard to humans if ingested, inhaled, or deposited on the\nskin. It may cause skin irritation or rashes, nausea and\nvomiting, nervousness or irritability, accelerated heartbeat,\nconvulsions or seizures, and dizziness or clumsiness. In rare\ncases, the ingestion of the compound has resulted in a\nperson’s death. It has also been classed as a likely carcinogen\nby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
