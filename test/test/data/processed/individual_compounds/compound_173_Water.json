It is a very stable compound that\nundergoes a number of important reactions. It reacts with some\nmetals to form elemental hydrogen and an inorganic base. With\nsome metals, such as sodium and potassium, the reaction is\nquite violent. With other metals, such as iron, the reaction\noccurs only very slowly. Water is also a weak electrolyte, ioniz-\ning to form hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH–). The\nhydrogen ions occur in solution as hydronium ions (H3O+).\nWater is also a strong dipole. A dipole is a molecule in\nwhich electrical charges are sufficiently separated from each\nother that one part of the molecule is negatively charged and\nanother part, positively charged. Water’s dipole character is\nresponsible for many of its special characteristics. The posi-\ntive end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative\nend of a second water molecule, resulting in the formation of\na weak (‘‘hydrogen’’) bond between the two molecules.\nO\nH\nH\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n879\n",
