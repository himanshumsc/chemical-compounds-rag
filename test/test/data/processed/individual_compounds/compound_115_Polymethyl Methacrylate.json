It is also\nwidely used in dentistry and medicine. A thermoplastic resin is\none that becomes soft when heated and hard when cooled. It can\nbe converted back and forth any number of times between the\nsolid and liquid states by further heating and cooling.\nPolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is more transparent\nthan glass and six to seventeen times more resistant to\nbreakage than glass.

After five years\nof research, one of the firm’s founders, Otto Ro¨hm, found a\nway of manufacturing sheets of polymethylmethacrylate. He\npatented his invention and the company was soon producing the\nH\nC\nCH2\nCH2\nCH3\nC\nO\nn\nO\n–\n–\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n583\n\nproduct under the trade name of Plexiglas\u0002. At about the\nsame time, the product was being developed independently\nin the United States by the Dow chemical company, who\nsold its product under the trade name of Lucite\u0002. Over time,\na number of other chemical companies produced their own\nversion of PMMA under a variety of trade names, including\nAcrylite\u0002,\nAcrypet\u0002,\nCrinothene\u0002,\nDegalan\u0002,\nDiakon\u0002,\nElvacite\u0002, Kallocryl\u0002, Metaplex\u0002, Osteobond\u0002, Paraglas\u0002,\nPerspex\u0002, Pontalite\u0002, Sumipex\u0002, Superacryl\u0002, and Vedril\u0002.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe monomer from which polymethylmethacrylate is\nmade is methyl methacrylate, CH2=C(CH3)COOCH3. Methyl\nPoly(methyl methacrylate).\nRed atoms are oxygen; white\natoms are hydrogen; black\natoms are carbon. Gray stick\nshows a double bond.\nP U B L I S H E R S R E S O U R C E G R O U P\n584\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nPOLYMETHYL METHACRYLATE\n\nmethacrylate is made in the reaction between acetone cyano-\nhydrin ((CH3)2COHCN) and methanol (methyl alcohol; CH3OH)\nin the presence of a sulfuric acid catalyst. As with all polymers,\nmethyl methacrylate can be polymerized by a number of\nagents, including heat, radiation, and certain chemicals known\nas free-radical initiators. Once polymerization of methyl metha-\ncrylate begins, it can be processed in a number of ways. One of\nthe most common processing system used involves passing\nthe liquid material between two polished stainless steel belts.\nThe distance between the belts is set to the desired thickness\nfor the acrylic sheet. The acrylic is cured by a process of cooling\nand heating after leaving the steel belt. The final product is\nthen cut to desired lengths at the end of the production line.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe most common use for PMMA is as a glass substitute.\nPMMA offers many benefits over glass because it is more\ntransparent, less dense, stronger, and shatterproof. In ophthal-\nmology (the branch of medicine that deals with diseases of the\neye and their treatment), PMMA is used to make replacement\nlenses for the eye when the original lens has been removed for\nInteresting Facts\n• Polymethylmethacrylate\nexhibits a phenomenon\nknown as total internal\nreflection. That term means\nthat a light beam trans-\nmitted through a solid tube\nmade of PMMA reflects off\nthe inner surface of the\ntube. This property allows a\nlight beam to be trans-\nmitted around corners and\nbends and out the end of a\ntube made of PMMA.\n• A black-light reactive tatoo\nink made from PMMA and\nmicrospheres of fluores-\ncent dye is used on wildlife\nto track activities such as\nmigration and growth pat-\nterns.\n• The spectator shield in\nhockey arenas is made\nof PMMA.\n• Plexiglas\u0002 was exhibited\nby Rohm & Haas at the\nWorld’s Trade Fair in Paris\nin 1937.
