It is odorless with a sharp, cool, salty taste. It is slightly\nhygroscopic, that is, having a tendency to absorb moisture\nfrom the air. Potassium nitrate, more commonly known as\nsaltpeter or niter, has been used by humans for many cen-\nturies.

The\ncompound is used as an oxidizing agent in such preparations.\nAn oxidizing agent is a substance that provides oxygen for\nthe combustion of some other material. For example, gun-\npowder, the oldest known explosive, is a mixture of potas-\nsium nitrate, charcoal (nearly pure carbon), and sulfur. When\nthe mixture is ignited, the carbon and sulfur burn very\nrapidly to produce carbon dioxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide\n(SO2. At the same time, the potassium nitrate decomposes\nto produce a variety of products, one of which is nitric oxide\n(NO). The rapid formation of very hot gases is responsible for\nthe shock wave produced in the explosion.\nPotassium nitrate.
