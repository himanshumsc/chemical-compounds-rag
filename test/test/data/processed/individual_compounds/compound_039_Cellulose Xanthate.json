The subscript ‘‘n’’ in the chemical formula\nindicates that many molecules chain together to make\nup the polymer.

Today, the Cross-Bevan-Beadle method of making rayon\nis only one of four processes used by the industry to make\nthe fiber.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe process to make rayon begins with wood pulp or\nwood chips, usually from spruce or pine trees. The wood is\ntreated with carbon disulfide (CS2), which converts cellulose\nin the wood to cellulose xanthate. The purpose of this step is\nto change an insoluble material (cellulose) into a soluble\nmaterial (cellulose xanthate). The cellulose xanthate is then\ndissolved in sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong alkali, form-\ning a thick, viscous solution. The viscosity of the solution is\nresponsible for the name given to this method of making\nrayon, the viscose process.\nThe cellulose xanthate solution is then allowed to stand\nfor eight to ten hours in a ‘‘ripening room.’’ During this period,\nthe cellulose xanthate slowly gives up its carbon disulfide\nand reverts to cellulose. The end result of these steps is the\nrecovery of cellulose in a form that is easier to work with and\nfrom which long fibers can be made.
