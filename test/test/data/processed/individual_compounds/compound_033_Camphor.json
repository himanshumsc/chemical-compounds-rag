It is\na volatile white waxy substance with a strong, characteristic\nodor and a bitter, cooling taste. Its odor has been described as\nfragrant, aromatic, pungent, or penetrating, similar to that\nof mothballs.

The\ncamphor thus obtained is one of two possible isomers, the\ndextrorotary (or ‘‘+’’) form of the compound. (The other isomer\nis the levorotatory or ‘‘-’’ form.) Since the natural sources of\ncamphor are inadequate to meet commercial demand, camphor\nis also made synthetically. The process begins by converting\nthe straight-chain hydrocarbons in turpentine oil (C10H16)\nto a cyclic isomer, a-pinene (c-C10H16), which is then oxidized\nto make camphor. Synthetic camphor differs from natural\ncamphor in that it consists of both isomers of the compound,\nthe dextrorotary (+) and levorotatory (-) forms. This difference\nhas no effect on the chemical properties of camphor, although\nit has some modest effect on its biological properties.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nCamphor has a long history of medicinal use. People\nhave used it as a liniment to treat muscle aches and arthri-\ntis; as a topical anesthetic; as a treatment for nervousness\nand hysteria; to treat diarrhea, bronchitis, and infectious\nfevers; and even as an injection to cure heart failure. Very\nlittle medical evidence exists for most of these treatments.\nAs a result, its primary medicinal use today is in lotions and\nointments for the relief of mild pain and discomfort due to\narthritis, rheumatism, and sore muscles. Some common pro-\nducts that contain camphor are Absorbine Arthritic Pain\nLotion\u0002, Ben-Gay\u0002, Campho-phenique\u0002, Panalgesic\u0002, Sloan’s\nLiniment\u0002, and Vicks VapoRub\u0002. In these preparations, the\ncompound acts as both a mild analgesic (pain-reliever) and\nantiseptic (an agent to prevent the growth of disease-causing\nmicroorganisms). Its pronounced odor may also help open\nnasal passages. Camphor is also an important ingredient in\nInteresting Facts\nDespite its name, the\ncamphor tree, Cinnamomum\ncamphora, does not produce\ncinnamon.
