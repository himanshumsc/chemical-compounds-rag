But solid scientific evidence for the role of\nfluorides in preventing tooth decay was not available until\nthe 1940s. Even then, the idea of adding fluorides to tooth-\npastes to reduce the risk of tooth decade was hampered by\nresearchers’ inability to find suitable fluoride compounds to\nuse for this purpose.
