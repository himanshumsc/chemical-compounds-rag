The monosac-\ncharides in pectin are different from and more complex than\nglucose.\nPectin occurs naturally in many fruits and vegetables.\nIt is most abundant in citrus fruits such as lemons, oranges,\nand grapefruits, which may consist of up to 30 percent pectin.\nIn pure form it is a yellowish-white powder with virtually no\nC\nO\nO\nO\nO\nC\nOH\nOH\nC\nC\nC\nO\nO\nO\nC\nOH\nOH\nC\nC\nC\nO\nC\nOH\nOH\nOH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nO\nO\nC\nC\nCH3\nO\nO\nC\nCH3\nC\nn\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n531\n\nodor and a slightly gummy taste. When dissolved in water, it\nforms a thick, jelly-like mass. This property explains one of\nits primary purposes: the jelling of fruits when they are made\ninto jams and jellies.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nPectin is made naturally in ripening fruit. It is obtained\ncommercially by treating the raw material (citrus peel or\napple pomace) with hot, acidified water. (Apple pomace is\nthe residue remaining after pressing of apples.) The pectin\nin the peel or apple pomace dissolves in the hot water and is\nthen purified by repeated filtrations. It is extracted from the\nwater solution by adding alcohol or an aluminum salt to the\nsolution, causing the pectin to precipitate out of solution.\nThe precipitate is then dried and ground into a powder.\nAdditional steps are sometimes carried out to convert the\npectin produced by this method, called high ester pectin, to a\nform that is more soluble: low ester pectin. To achieve this\nchange, high ester pectin is treated with either acids or\nalkalis, washed, and purified.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nPectin is used primarily as a jelling agent in the manu-\nfacture of jams and jellies. It also has a number of other\napplications as a food additive. For example, it is added to\nsome yogurts to provide the consistency that allows the\nyogurt to hold its shape and still be capable of being stirred.\nIt is added to concentrated fruit drinks to keep the solid and\nliquid components of the drink in suspension with each other.\nIt is also an ingredient in fruit and milk desserts, added to\nensure that the final product has the proper consistency and\nstability.\nPectin is also used as an additive in pharmaceutical and\ncosmetic preparations. It acts as an emulsifying agent, to\nstabilize the product, or to give it the proper consistency.\nIn combination with an antibiotic, pectin has also been used\nas an anti-diarrheal agent. Some studies have shown that daily\ndoses of pectin may have a small but significant lowering\neffect on cholesterol levels.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has classified\npectin as an approved food additive.
