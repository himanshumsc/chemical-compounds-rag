It is a white, translucent,\nodorless, granular powder or crystalline material that tends\nto absorb water from the air. As it does, it is converted into\nthe sesquihydrate (‘‘sesqui’’ = one-and-a-half) with the formula\nK2CO3\u00031.5H2O.

The primary\nuses of potassium carbonate are in the production of fertili-\nzers, soaps, and heat-resistant glass.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nMost of the potassium carbonate made in the United\nStates is produced beginning with potassium chloride (KCl)\nobtained from seven mines in New Mexico, Michigan, and\nUtah. The potassium chloride is first converted to potassium\nhydroxide (KOH) by electrolysis. The potassium hydroxide is\nthen treated with carbon dioxide (CO2) to obtain potassium\nbicarbonate (KHCO3). Finally, the potassium bicarbonate is\ndecomposed by heating, yielding water, carbon dioxide, and\npotassium carbonate.\nAnother method of preparation, called the Engel-Precht\nprocess, is a modification of this procedure.
