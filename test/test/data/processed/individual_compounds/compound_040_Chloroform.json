The chemical structure of the\ncompound was determined by French chemist Jean-Baptiste-\nAndre´ Dumas (1800–1884), who suggested its modern name\nof chloroform in 1834 or 1835. The compound’s anesthetic\neffects on animals were first observed by French physio-\nlogist Marie Jean-Pierre Flourens (1794–1867) in 1847.\nThe potential value of chloroform as an anesthetic for\nhumans was immediately evident. In Great Britain, Liverpool\nchemist David Waldie (1813–1889) suggested to a surgeon\nfriend of his, Sir James Young Simpson (1811–1870), that he\nmight try using chloroform instead of ether to ease the pain\nof childbirth with his patients.

The use of chloroform as a painkiller soon\nspread widely throughout Great Britain and other countries\nof the world.\nIn the twenty-first century, chloroform has been almost\nentirely replaced as an anesthetic by other compounds that are\nmore effective and have fewer undesirable side effects.
