Mix-\ntures differ from compounds in a number of important ways.\nThe parts that make up a mixture are not chemically com-\nbined with each other, as they are in a compound. Also,\nmixtures have no definite composition, but consist of vary-\ning amounts of the substances from which they are formed.\nGelatin is a mixture of water-soluble proteins with high\nmolecular weights. It typically occurs as a brittle solid in\nthe form of colorless or slightly yellow flakes or sheets, or\nin powder form, with virtually no taste or odor. It absorbs up\nto ten times its own weight when mixed with cold water and\ndissolves in hot water. When a solution of gelatin in hot\nwater is cooled, it takes the form of a gel, a jelly-like material\nperhaps most commonly seen as the popular dessert called\nJELL-OTM. Gelatin is also available in a number of other\ncommercial forms, such as Knox GelatinTM, Puragel\u0002, and\nGelfoam\u0002. Gelatin has been known to humans for many\ncenturies, but it was not widely marketed until the late\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n337\n\n1890s. Its name comes from the Latin word gelatus, which\nmeans ‘‘frozen.’’\nHOW IT IS MADE\nGelatin is made by boiling animal parts with high pro-\ntein content, such as skin, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and\nbones. The boiling process breaks down molecular bonds\nbetween individual collagen strands in the animal tissue.\nCollagen is a structural protein found in bone, cartilage,\nand connective tissue. The collagen formed by this process\ncan be further disintegrated through additional boiling with\neither acid or alkali. Type A gelatin is produced when col-\nlagen is boiled in an acidic solution, and type B gelatin is\nproduced by boiling collagen in an alkaline solution.\nMost of the animal parts used to make gelatin come from\ncattle and pigs and are left over from meat and leather\nprocessing. Gelatin can also be made from fish. One of the\noldest forms of gelatin is isinglass, made from the swim\nbladders of fish. Jewish and Muslim dietary laws prohibit\nbelievers from eating pork, so some gelatin is made without\npig parts. Vegetarians and vegans do not eat any animal\nproducts, so gelatin manufacturers also make similar pro-\nducts using vegetable carbohydrates, such as agar and pectin.\nThese vegetarian gelatins are not true gelatin, which is\nalways made from animal proteins.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nPeople discovered gelatin centuries ago and experimen-\nted with various uses for it. In the early 1800s, for example,\ngelatin was included in the food served to French soldiers as\na source of dietary proteins. In the 1890s, Knox GelatinTM\nwas sold as a cure for dry fingernails. Manufacturers claimed\nthat dry fingernails were caused by a lack of protein and that\neating gelatin would cure the condition. No scientific evi-\ndence exists for that claim, but Knox GelatinTM became\npopular among consumers nonetheless.\nIn 1900, the Genesee Pure Food Company began selling\nflavored gelatin under the name JELL-OTM.
