This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance. Even then, Lebedev’s invention, called polybuta-\ndiene, was primarily a laboratory curiosity.

As a result,\nchemists in Europe and the United States began to look for\nsynthetic substitutes for natural rubber. Lebedev’s discovery\nprovided one solution to this problem, and butadiene-based\nsynthetic rubber products were soon flowing from manufac-\nturing plants.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nButadiene is made by three processes in the United\nStates. The first two of those processes begin with four-\ncarbon\ncompounds\ncalled\nbutane\n(CH3CH2CH2CH3)\nand\nbutene (CH2=CHCH2CH3 and CH3CH=CHCH3). These com-\npounds are treated in one of two ways so as to add one more\ndouble bond to the molecules, resulting in the formation of\n1,3-butadiene (CH2=CHCH=CH2). The third and most common\nprocess is known as steam cracking. Steam cracking is a\nprocess by which large petroleum molecules are exposed to\nvery hot steam, causing them to break apart into smaller\nmolecules. Steam cracking is the method by which ethylene,\nthe most important organic chemical produced in the United\nStates, is made. 1,3-butadiene is a by-product of this process,\nand is separated from the major product, ethylene, after\ncracking is complete.\n1,3 Butadiene.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2).
