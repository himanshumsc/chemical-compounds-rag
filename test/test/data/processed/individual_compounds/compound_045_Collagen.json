Approximately one third of the protein in a\nmammal’s body is collagen. It makes up a major portion of the\nconnective tissue found in skin, joints, ligaments, muscles, ten-\ndons, and bones. Different types of collagen occur in different\nspecies. That is, the collagen found in humans is somewhat dif-\nferent fromthatfoundin cows,and bothhumanandcowcollagen\ndiffer from the collagen found in other animals, such as dogs and\nats. Nonetheless, all forms of collagen have a common molecular\nstructure that consists of three rope-like strands intertwined\nwith each other. Each strand (called tropocollagen) is a polymer\nconsistingofaminoacids,themostcommonofwhichareglycine,\nproline, and hydroxyproline. Collagens differ from each other in\nregard to the relative amounts of each amino acid present.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nCollagen is synthesized in the bodies of all higher verte-\nbrates in a complex series of reactions that begin with the\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n239\n\nlinking of amino acids with each other. Amino acids are\norganic compounds that contain both the carboxyl group\n(-COOH) and the amino group (-NH2). The amino acids are\njoined to each other in very long chains known as polypep-\ntides (a word meaning ‘‘many amino acids’’). After assembly,\npolypeptide chains intertwine with each other in groups\nof three to make large molecules called procollagen (‘‘early\ncollagen’’), which is then cut into smaller pieces by enzymes\ndesigned especially for that purpose. The three strands that\nmake up each collagen group are held together by the action\nof vitamin C molecules.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAll of the connective tissue in the body contains col-\nlagen. This collagen is flexible but not stretchy and will tear\nif pulled to strongly. Collagen is also a primary component of\ncartilage, the material that fills the gaps between bones and\nfills out structures that are firm but somewhat soft, such as\nthe end of the nose and ears. There are at least a dozen types\nof collagen in the body, each one with a slightly different\nphysical and chemical structure.\nType I is the most abundant kind of collagen. It forms\nlong strands that criss-cross the spaces between cells and is\nfound throughout the body, particularly in tendons, bones,\nand scars.

Type IV collagen comprises the basal lumina, the mem-\nbrane that supports skin and internal surfaces. The eight\nother types of collagen all have their specific functions in\nthe body.\nPlastic surgeons use collagen to fill wrinkles and lines in\ntheir patients’ faces and bodies. As people age, the tissue that\nfills out their faces and makes the skin look smooth and\ntight breaks down, leaving lines and wrinkles. Injecting col-\nlagen into wrinkles fills the area under the skin with tissue\nthat puffs out the skin, making it firm and smooth again.\nDoctors also use collagen to fill in scars.
