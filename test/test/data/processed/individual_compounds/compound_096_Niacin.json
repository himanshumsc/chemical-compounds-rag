Lack of niacin causes\na disease called pellagra. Pellagra was common throughout\nhuman history among poor people whose diet consisted almost\nentirely of corn products. Those corn products did not supply\nadequate amounts of niacin, causing symptoms such as diar-\nrhea, scaly skin sores, inflamed mucous membranes, weak-\nness, irritability, and mental delusions.
