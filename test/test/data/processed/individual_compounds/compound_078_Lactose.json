The lac-\ntose content of milk ranges from about 2 to 8 percent in cows\nand 5 to 8 percent in human milk. Lactose occurs in two\nisomeric forms, a-lactose and b-lactose, with the latter some-\nwhat sweeter than the former. The alpha form tends to occur\nas the monohydrate, C12H22O11\u0003H2O.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nLactose is synthesized in the mammary (milk-producing)\nglands of mammals. The milk of such animals contains an\nenzyme called lactose synthetase, which acts on the com-\npound uridine diphosphate D-galactose to produce lactose.\nThe compound is obtained commercially from whey, a bypro-\nduct of the cheese-making process. The solids in whey con-\ntain about 70 percent lactose by weight.

After removal\nof minerals in the whey, the resulting solution consists of\nabout 50 to 65 percent by weight, which is allowed to crystal-\nlize out of the resulting solutions. The lactose produced by\nthis process is a racemic mixture of the D and L isomers. To\nobtain the alpha isomer, the lactose is dissolved with water\nand treated with activated carbon to remove any color. When\nthe water evaporates from the solution, a-lactose monohy-\ndrate remains. The product is most commonly made available\nin this form. To obtain the beta isomer, a-lactose is heated\nwith water in the presence of a base, which converts the\nalpha isomer to its beta form.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nBoth forms of lactose are used in the preparation of baby\nfoods and food for infants and for convalescents. It is also\nused in the dairy industry to feed foals that have been\nLactose. Red atoms are\noxygen; white atoms are\nhydrogen; and black atoms\nare carbon.
