It is the sodium salt of a common amino acid called\nglutamic acid. An organic salt is a compound formed when an\ninorganic base, such as sodium hydroxide, reacts with an\norganic acid, such as glutamic acid.\nMonosodium glutamate has been available as a commer-\ncial product for about a century. But the compound has been\nused in its natural form for much longer. The ancient Greeks\nand Romans used fish sauce, which contains glutamic acid as\na natural ingredient, in their cooking. Later Europeans also\nused a form of the substance in a product known as garum.\nThe German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen (1826-\n1912) first identified glutamic acid in wheat gluten in 1866,\nand its chemical structure was first identified in 1890 by the\nGerman chemist Wolff.
