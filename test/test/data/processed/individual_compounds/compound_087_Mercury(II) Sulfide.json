Red mercury(II) sulfide, commonly\nknown as cinnabar, begins to change color when heated to\ntemperatures of about 250\u0002C (500\u0002F) and converts to the black\nform at 386\u0002C (727\u0002F). If heated further, it sublimes (changes\ndirectly from a solid to a gas without first melting) at 583.5\u0002C\n(1,082\u0002F). If allowed to cool, it then reverts to its original\nreddish color. Black mercury(II) sulfide goes through a similar\nprocess, changing to its red counterpart before melting at\n583.5\u0002C (1,082\u0002F). Some authoritative resources give signifi-\ncantly different temperatures for these transitions. Red\nmercury(II) sulfide occurs naturally as the mineral cinnabar,\nwhile black mercury(II) sulfide occurs only rarely in nature, then\nas the mineral metacinnabar (meaning ‘similar to cinnabar’).\nHOW IT IS MADE\nRed mercury(II) sulfide is obtained commercially from\nthe mineral cinnabar. The compound can also be made\nS\nHg\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n439\n\nsynthetically by heating mercury and sulfur together in a\ngaseous state or by heating mercury with a solution of\npotassium pentasulfide (K2S5). The compound produced by\neither of these methods is commonly known as English ver-\nmillion, or simply, vermillion. The term vermillion is gener-\nally reserved for any form of mercury(II) sulfide that has\nbeen made synthetically rather than extracted from cinna-\nbar. Other methods for the preparation of both red and black\nmercury(II) sulfide are available. For example, the black form\ncan be produced by reacting sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3)\nwith sodium mercurichloride (Na2HgCl4).\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe earliest records of the use of mercury(II) sulfide by\nhumans date to about the third millennium BCE in China,\nwhere the compound was used to cure diseases, relieve pain,\nas a narcotic and an antiseptic, and as a preservative.
