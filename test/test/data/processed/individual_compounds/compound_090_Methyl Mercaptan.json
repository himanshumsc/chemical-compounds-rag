Methyl\nmercaptan has only one carbon atom, but some mercaptans\ncontain up to twenty carbon atoms. Like methyl mercaptan,\nother mercaptan compounds are known for their disagreeable\nodors. For example, allyl mercaptan has the characteristic\nsmell of garlic, while butyl mercaptan occurs in the spray that\nskunks release to protect themselves from predators.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nMethyl mercaptan is made by the direct reaction between\nmethanol (methyl alcohol; CH3OH) and hydrogen sulfide gas\nS\nH\nH3C\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n455\n\n(H2S). The hydroxyl group (-OH) from the alcohol combines\nwith one hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide to form water,\nleaving the methyl mercaptan behind as the major product.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nMethyl mercaptan’s primary use is in the synthesis of\nother organic compounds, especially pesticides, fungicides,\njet fuel components, plastics, and the amino acid methionine\n[CH3SCH2CH2CG(NH2)COOH]. Amino acids are the building-\nblock compounds from which proteins are made. The com-\npound is also used as an odorant, a substance with a notice-\nable and usually offensive odor added to odorless compounds\nfor the purpose of safety. For example, propane and natural\ngas are two widely used gases that are very flammable, but\nodorless. If these gases were used without having an odorant\nadded, consumers might not be aware of a leak until the gas\ncaught fire or exploded. The presence of the odorant, such as\nmethyl mercaptan, makes a leak obvious and allows it to be\nrepaired before an accident occurs.\nIn spite of the fact that it is a natural product, methyl\nmercaptan is a health and environmental risk. When inhaled,\nit can irritate the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs, producing\nMethyl mercaptan. White\natoms are hydrogen; black atom\nis carbon; and yellow atom is\nsulfur.
