Although calcium hydroxide is not very soluble in\nwater, a suspension of the finely divided powder in water can\nbe made, a suspension known as limewater or milk of lime.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nCalcium hydroxide is produced by adding water to cal-\ncium oxide (CaO).

It is found in mortar, plasters, and cements.\nWhen used in mortar, calcium hydroxide is mixed with sand\nand water to make a paste. The paste is put between bricks to\nhold them together. When water in the paste evaporates, the\nremaining sand-calcium hydroxide mixture becomes a hard,\nstrong adhesive holding the bricks together.\nCalcium hydroxide is also used extensively as a neutraliz-\ning agent. As a base, it reacts with acids formed in industrial\noperations, in the environment, and in other situations. For\nexample, soil that is too acidic for plants to grow properly can\nbe treated with calcium hydroxide. The hydroxide ion (OH\u0002) in\nthe calcium hydroxide reacts with the hydrogen ion (H+) in\nthe acidic soil to form water, resulting in a more neutral soil.\nCalcium hydroxide.
