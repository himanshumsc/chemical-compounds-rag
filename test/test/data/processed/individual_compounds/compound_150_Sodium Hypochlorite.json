The anhydrous compound is\nvery unstable and explodes readily. The pentahydrate is a pale-\ngreen crystalline solid that is relatively stable.

Neither\ncotton nor linen, two very popular fabrics, are naturally very\nwhite, so efforts were made to find ways to convert them to\nwhite materials. Those efforts were not very successful until\nthe discovery of chlorine by the Swedish chemist Karl\nWilhelm Scheele (1742–1786) in the 1770s. The powerful\noxidizing powers of chlorine made it a likely candidate for\nuse as a bleach (although chemists at the time did not under-\nstand how bleaching occurred). The first person to take advan-\ntage of chlorine’s bleaching powers was the French chemist\nClaude Louis Berthollet (1748–1822), who lived in Javelle,\nFrance. Berthollet produced a weak solution of sodium hypo-\nchlorite by passing chlorine gas through sodium carbonate.\nThe product had excellent bleaching powers, and it became\nknown by the name of eau de Javelle or eau de Berthollet.\nBerthollet’s invention came at just the right time.

Some examples of the ways in which sodium hypo-\nchlorite is used include:\n• For the sterilization of milking equipment and contain-\ners at dairy farms;\n• For the cleaning and sterilization of work surfaces by\namateur and professional beer and wine makers;\n• As an ingredient in home cleaning agents, such as toilet\nbowl sanitizers, mold removers, and drain cleaners; and\n• As a disinfectant in private water wells to prevent the\ngrowth of microorganisms.\nAbout half of all the sodium hypochlorite used for indus-\ntrial purposes is consumed in municipal and water treatment\nsystems.
