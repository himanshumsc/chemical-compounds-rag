      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of sodium fluoride (NaF). In this diagram, the green sphere represents a fluorine atom, while the turquoise sphere represents a sodium atom. Sodium fluoride is an ionic compound formed by the combination of sodium ions (Na⁺) and fluoride ions (F⁻). It is commonly used to prevent tooth decay and is added to toothpaste and municipal water supplies. It is effective in strengthening tooth enamel and reducing dental caries.",

      "question": "Explain the chemical reaction involved in producing Sodium Fluoride using hydrogen fluoride and sodium carbonate.",
      "answer": "Sodium fluoride can be produced by treating hydrogen fluoride (HF) with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The chemical reaction involved is as follows:\n\n\\[ 2HF + Na2CO3 \\rightarrow 2NaF + H2O + CO2 \\]\n\nIn this reaction, hydrogen fluoride reacts with sodium carbonate to form sodium fluoride, water, and carbon dioxide. Sodium fluoride is the desired product, while water and carbon dioxide are byproducts.",
