      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of potassium sulfate (K₂SO₄). The structure includes oxygen atoms (red), a sulfur atom (yellow), and potassium atoms (turquoise). Potassium sulfate is commonly used as a fertilizer, providing essential potassium and sulfur to plants. It is particularly beneficial for crops sensitive to chloride, such as coffee, tea, and potatoes. However, it is more expensive than fertilizers that contain potassium chloride.",

      "question": "Describe the process of producing potassium sulfate from langbeinite and potassium chloride.",
      "answer": "Potassium sulfate is produced from langbeinite by first crushing and washing the mineral, which is composed of the double salt K2Mg2(SO4)3. This process separates the double salt, after which potassium chloride (KCl) is used to further separate the components of langbeinite. The reaction is as follows: K2Mg2(SO4)3 + 4KCl → 3K2SO4 + 2MgCl2. Through this process, potassium sulfate (K2SO4) is extracted, leaving behind magnesium chloride (MgCl2).",
