      "question": "Explain the process by which Dimethyl Ketone is produced using the Hock process.",
      "answer": "Dimethyl ketone, commonly known as acetone, can be produced via the Hock process. In this method, cumene (chemical formula C6H5CH(CH3)2) undergoes oxidation to form cumene hydroperoxide (C6H5C(CH3)2COOH). This intermediate is then reduced to yield acetone and phenol (C6H5OH). This process is one of the primary industrial methods for acetone production.",
