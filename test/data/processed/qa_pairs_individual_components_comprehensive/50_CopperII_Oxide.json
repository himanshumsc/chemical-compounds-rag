      "question": "Explain the process of synthesizing Copper(II) Oxide from copper nitrate and its potential use in industry.",
      "answer": "Copper(II) oxide can be synthesized from copper(II) nitrate [Cu(NO3)2] by heating it to red heat. This process involves thermal decomposition, where the copper nitrate is heated until it breaks down to form copper(II) oxide. \n\nIn industry, Copper(II) oxide finds several applications. It is used as a pigment to color ceramics, enamels, porcelain glazes, and artificial gems, imparting a bluish to greenish tint. Additionally, it serves as an insecticide and fumigant. Copper(II) oxide is also employed as a catalyst in many industrial and commercial chemical reactions. However, it's important to note that inhaling copper(II) oxide fumes can cause metal fume fever, characterized by throat irritation and coughing.",
