      "question": "Explain why calcium hydroxide often becomes contaminated and how can this be prevented.",
      "answer": "Calcium hydroxide often becomes contaminated because it readily absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which transforms it into calcium carbonate (CaCO3). To prevent this contamination, calcium hydroxide should be stored in tightly sealed containers to limit its exposure to air.",

      "question": "Describe the role of calcium hydroxide in neutralizing acidic soils and the chemical process involved.",
      "answer": "Calcium hydroxide, also known as slaked lime, plays a significant role in neutralizing acidic soils. It is a relatively inexpensive chemical used in processes where a base is needed. The neutralization process involves the reaction between calcium hydroxide and the hydrogen ions (H+) present in the acidic soil. The hydroxide ions (OH-) in the calcium hydroxide react with these hydrogen ions to form water, thereby reducing the acidity of the soil and resulting in a more neutral pH level. This adjustment is crucial for improving soil conditions to promote optimal plant growth. Calcium hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water, but it can be suspended as a finely divided powder in water, known as limewater or milk of lime, which facilitates its application in soil treatment.",
