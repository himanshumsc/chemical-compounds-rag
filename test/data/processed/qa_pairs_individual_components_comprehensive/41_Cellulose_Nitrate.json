      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of cellulose nitrate. This compound is characterized by the presence of nitrate groups (NO₃) attached to the cellulose backbone. Key properties of cellulose nitrate include its flammability and use as an explosive, historically known as \"guncotton.\" It is also used in the production of lacquers and as a film base. Modifying its preparation can significantly change its chemical and physical properties, influencing its applications.",

      "question": "How does the nitrogen content affect the solubility properties of cellulose nitrate?",
      "answer": "The nitrogen content in cellulose nitrate affects its solubility properties. According to the provided information, the \"high nitrogen\" form of cellulose nitrate is soluble in acetone but insoluble in an alcohol/ether mixture. In contrast, the \"low-nitrogen\" form is soluble in both acetone and an alcohol/ether mixture. Thus, the amount of nitrogen present in cellulose nitrate can significantly influence its solubility in different solvents.",

      "question": "Describe the discovery of cellulose nitrate and its initial observation by Christian Friedrich Schönbein.",
      "answer": "Cellulose nitrate was discovered in 1845 by the Swiss-German chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein. The discovery occurred accidentally when Schönbein used his wife’s cotton apron to clean up a spill of nitric acid on the laboratory floor. He observed that the cotton and nitric acid reacted to form a new compound that exploded when heated, releasing a puff of black smoke. Schönbein immediately recognized the potential applications of this new compound.",
