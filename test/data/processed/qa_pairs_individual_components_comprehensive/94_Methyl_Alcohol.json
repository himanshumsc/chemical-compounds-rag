      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is methyl alcohol, also known as methanol (CH₃OH). It consists of a carbon atom (black), an oxygen atom (red), and hydrogen atoms (white). Methanol is a simple alcohol and is a colorless, volatile liquid with a distinctive odor. It is used as an industrial solvent, antifreeze, and fuel. Methanol is also employed in the production of formaldehyde and other chemicals. It is toxic to humans if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin.",

      "question": "Explain how methyl alcohol is commercially produced.",
      "answer": "Methyl alcohol, also known as methanol, is commercially produced primarily by reacting carbon monoxide with water at a temperature of about 250°C (480°F) and pressures of 50 to 100 atmospheres over a mixed catalyst of copper, zinc oxide, and aluminum oxide. While there are experimental methods, such as oxidizing simple hydrocarbons like methane over a molybdenum metal catalyst, these methods have not yet been able to compete with the traditional carbon monoxide-hydrogen process for commercial production.",

      "question": "Discuss the environmental concerns associated with the use of methyl alcohol in producing MTBE and the impact on its demand.",
      "answer": "Methyl alcohol, also known as methanol, has been widely used in the production of MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl ether), a gasoline additive designed to improve fuel efficiency and reduce atmospheric pollutants. However, environmental concerns have arisen regarding MTBE's potential hazards. Specifically, MTBE has been linked to serious environmental dangers when released into the soil, prompting a reevaluation of its use. As a result, enthusiasm for MTBE has waned, with several states implementing bans on its use as a gasoline additive. Consequently, the demand for methyl alcohol in the production of MTBE has significantly decreased in recent years.",
