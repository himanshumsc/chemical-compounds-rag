      "question": "Explain the role of cyanocobalamin in the human body and the consequences of its deficiency.",
      "answer": "Cyanocobalamin, commonly known as vitamin B12, is crucial for human health, specifically in DNA synthesis within cells and the proper functioning of red blood cells and nerves. It exists in several active forms, including hydroxocobalamin and nitrocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or a red powder that is odorless and tasteless and is soluble in water and alcohol but insoluble in acetone, ether, and chloroform. \n\nA deficiency in vitamin B12 leads to pernicious anemia, characterized by smaller and fewer red blood cells with reduced hemoglobin content. This condition causes general weakness, nervous disorders, gastrointestinal issues, and can be fatal if untreated. Cyanocobalamin is essential for producing properly functioning red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.",
