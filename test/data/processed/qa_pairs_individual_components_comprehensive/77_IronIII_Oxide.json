      "question": "Explain the ferromagnetic property of Iron(III) oxide as mentioned in the compound information.",
      "answer": "Iron(III) oxide, also known as ferric oxide, has ferromagnetic properties. Ferromagnetism is the ability of a substance to become highly magnetic and retain its magnetism. This property allows Iron(III) oxide to be magnetized and remain magnetized, distinguishing it from materials that are only temporarily magnetized when exposed to a magnetic field. The compound's ferromagnetic characteristic is a key aspect of its physical properties.",

      "question": "Describe the process of how Iron(III) oxide is reduced to iron metal in a blast furnace.",
      "answer": "In a blast furnace, iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is reduced to iron metal through a process that involves carbon and heat. The furnace introduces a blast of air, which reacts with carbon to form carbon monoxide (CO). This carbon monoxide then reacts with the iron(III) oxide, reducing it to liquid iron metal and producing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct. This method of reduction has been refined over centuries and was in use as early as the first century BCE in China. The process allows the extraction of iron from its ore, making it a foundational technique in iron and steel manufacturing.",
