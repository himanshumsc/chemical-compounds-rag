      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of magnesium hydroxide. It consists of magnesium (turquoise), oxygen (red), and hydrogen (white) atoms. Magnesium hydroxide is a basic compound commonly used as an antacid, known as milk of magnesia. It reacts with stomach acid to reduce heartburn and discomfort. It's prepared by reacting magnesium chloride with sodium hydroxide or by treating seawater with lime. It forms a precipitate that settles out of solution.",

      "question": "Explain the process by which Magnesium Hydroxide is produced from seawater.",
      "answer": "Magnesium hydroxide is produced from seawater through a reaction involving lime (calcium oxide, CaO) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2), which is present in small amounts in seawater. In this process, seawater is treated with lime, and the calcium oxide reacts with the magnesium chloride to produce magnesium hydroxide. This magnesium hydroxide then settles out of the solution as a precipitate.",
