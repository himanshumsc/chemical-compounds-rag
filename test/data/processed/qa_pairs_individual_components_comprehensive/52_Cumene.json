      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the molecular structure diagram is cumene. Cumene, also known as isopropylbenzene, consists of a benzene ring with an isopropyl group attached. It is primarily used as a raw material in the production of phenol and acetone. Cumene is a volatile, flammable liquid with a distinct odor and is used in various industrial applications, such as in the manufacture of plastics. It can be a skin, eye, and respiratory irritant if inhaled.",

      "question": "Explain the primary industrial uses of cumene.",
      "answer": "Cumene is primarily used as a raw material in the synthesis of other organic compounds such as phenol, acetone, acetophenone, and methyl styrene. These compounds are crucial in the production of various plastics, including polystyrene, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and polycarbonates. Additionally, small amounts of cumene are used as thinners for paints, lacquers, and enamels, and as solvents in different types of coatings. Cumene is an important industrial chemical due to its role in the manufacturing processes of these widely used materials.",

      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction used to synthesize cumene and the alternative sources from which it can be extracted.",
      "answer": "Cumene is synthesized through a chemical reaction between benzene (C6H6) and propene (propylene; CH3CH=CH2). Additionally, cumene can be extracted from petroleum or coal tar, which is the thick black material left after soft coal is converted to coke.",
