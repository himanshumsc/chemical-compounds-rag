      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure in the image represents isopropyl alcohol (also known as isopropanol or 2-propanol). It is a colorless, flammable liquid with a strong odor. The structure shows carbon (black atoms), hydrogen (white atoms), and oxygen (red atom). \n\nKey properties of isopropyl alcohol include its ability to dissolve a wide range of non-polar compounds. It is commonly used as a solvent in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, a disinfectant, and a cleaning agent. Isopropyl alcohol is volatile and evaporates quickly, making it useful for applications requiring rapid drying.",

      "question": "Explain why isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as a rubbing alcohol in medical settings.",
      "answer": "Isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as rubbing alcohol in medical settings primarily because it is an effective antiseptic. It is a colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet odor and is known for its ability to kill bacteria on the skin, which helps prevent infection. Typically found as a 70 percent solution in water, isopropyl alcohol is used to clean the skin before injections. It is miscible with water and most common organic solvents, making it effective for dissolving many organic compounds. This property also contributes to its widespread use as a solvent in various applications.",
