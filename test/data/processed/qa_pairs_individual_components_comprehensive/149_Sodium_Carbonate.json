      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). In the structure, red atoms are oxygen, the black atom is carbon, and turquoise atoms are sodium. Sodium carbonate is a white, water-soluble salt with alkaline properties. It is commonly used in the manufacture of glass, detergents, and other industrial products. Historically, it was significant in ancient Egyptian mummification processes and as a component of natron. Sodium carbonate is also known as soda ash.",

      "question": "Discuss the significance of sodium carbonate's hygroscopic nature and its implications for storage.",
      "answer": "Sodium carbonate is hygroscopic, meaning it has a tendency to absorb moisture from the air. This property has significant implications for its storage. Being hygroscopic, sodium carbonate can readily absorb water, which can lead to clumping or changes in its physical state from a powder to a more solid mass. This can affect its usability and handling in industrial applications, such as in the manufacture of glass and other chemicals. Proper storage in airtight containers or in environments with controlled humidity is essential to maintain its stability and effectiveness. This is crucial to prevent the alteration of its physical properties, which could impact its primary uses and efficiency in industrial processes.",
