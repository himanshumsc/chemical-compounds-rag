      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of benzene, a chemical compound with the formula C₆H₆. Benzene consists of six carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal ring, with alternating single and double bonds, and each carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This structure is known for its stability due to resonance, where the electrons are delocalized over the ring. Benzene is a colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet odor and is used as a precursor in the production of many chemicals.",

      "question": "Explain why benzene's chemical structure was considered a mystery and how Friedrich August Kekulé contributed to understanding it.",
      "answer": "Benzene's chemical structure was considered a mystery because its molecular formula, C6H6, suggested the presence of three double bonds. In typical double-bonded substances, these bonds involve four electrons that hold two atoms in close proximity, imparting specific chemical properties. However, benzene did not exhibit the expected chemical behaviors of compounds containing double bonds. This discrepancy puzzled chemists for nearly half a century.\n\nFriedrich August Kekulé contributed significantly to understanding benzene's structure. In 1865, Kekulé proposed that the six carbon atoms in benzene are arranged in a ring, with alternating single and double bonds. This ring structure explained why benzene did not behave like other double-bonded compounds, as the electrons in the double bonds are delocalized around the ring rather than being fixed between two specific atoms. This model of alternating double bonds provided a satisfactory explanation for benzene's unique chemical properties and helped demystify its structure.",
