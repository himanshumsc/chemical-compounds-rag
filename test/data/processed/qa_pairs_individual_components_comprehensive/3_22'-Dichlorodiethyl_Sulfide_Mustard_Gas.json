      "question": "Explain why 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide is referred to as 'mustard gas' despite being a liquid at room temperature.",
      "answer": "2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl sulfide is referred to as 'mustard gas' despite being a liquid at room temperature because of its historical use as a chemical weapon and its distinctive odor. The compound is commonly known as mustard gas due to the smell of mustard, garlic, or horseradish that arises from impurities, even though in its pure form it has no odor. The name 'mustard gas' also originates from its first use as a chemical weapon by the German army in 1917, where it was employed in gaseous form. The term 'gas' in its name reflects its application in warfare rather than its physical state at room temperature.",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility characteristics of 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide and its implications for its use as a chemical agent.",
      "answer": "2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl sulfide, commonly known as mustard gas, has specific solubility characteristics that impact its use as a chemical agent. According to the provided information, mustard gas is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol, ether, acetone, and benzene, as well as in fats. This solubility profile means that mustard gas can easily penetrate and persist in environments where organic materials are present, making it an effective chemical warfare agent. Its insolubility in water means it is not easily washed away or neutralized by water-based methods, enhancing its persistence and potential harm when deployed. These characteristics facilitate its ability to cause blistering, eye irritation, and lung damage when it comes into contact with skin or is inhaled, contributing to its lethality and use in warfare.",
