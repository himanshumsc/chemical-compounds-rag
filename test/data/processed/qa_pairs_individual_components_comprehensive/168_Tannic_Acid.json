      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is tannic acid. It is a type of tannin, which is a class of compounds known for their ability to precipitate proteins. Tannic acid is used primarily in the tanning process, where it helps convert raw animal hides into leather by transforming proteins to resist decomposition. Additionally, it is used for staining wood, dyeing cloth, and treating minor cuts and wounds. The molecular structure includes red atoms representing oxygen, black atoms representing carbon, and white atoms representing hydrogen.",

      "question": "Describe the physical state and properties of tannic acid.",
      "answer": "Tannic acid is a pale yellow amorphous substance that may also appear as shiny scales or spongy material. It darkens gradually when exposed to air. This compound is odorless but has a strong, bitter taste. Tannic acid is solid at room temperature and begins to decompose at 210°C (410°F). It is soluble in water, ethyl alcohol, and acetone. The compound is derived from glucose where five hydroxyl groups have been replaced by digalloyl groups. Tannic acid naturally occurs in the bark of trees such as hemlock, chestnut, mangrove, and oak, as well as in sumac plants and plant galls. It is toxic by ingestion and can be a mild irritant to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract.",

      "question": "Explain the structural modification of glucose that leads to the formation of tannic acid.",
      "answer": "Tannic acid is a derivative of the simple sugar glucose (C6H12O6). In tannic acid, five hydroxyl groups (-OH) on the glucose molecule are replaced by large complex side chains known as digalloyl groups. This structural modification transforms glucose into tannic acid, resulting in a compound with the molecular formula C76H52O46.",
