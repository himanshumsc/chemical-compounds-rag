      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of theobromine. Theobromine is a compound primarily found in cocoa beans and chocolate. It is an alkaloid similar to caffeine, with stimulant properties, though milder. The compound contributes to the bitter flavor of dark chocolate. Theobromine has various effects on the body, including acting as a vasodilator, diuretic, and heart stimulant. It is also known to be toxic to some animals, like dogs, due to slower metabolism compared to humans.",

      "question": "How does theobromine affect the body differently than caffeine?",
      "answer": "Theobromine and caffeine are both methylxanthines, but they affect the body differently. Theobromine's effects are about ten times weaker than caffeine's. Caffeine is metabolized more quickly, is addictive, and increases alertness and emotional stress. It can have serious effects on the central nervous system and kidneys. In contrast, theobromine is not addictive, has no effect on the central nervous system, and provides only gentle stimulation to the kidneys. Theobromine's effects last longer than caffeine's and produce feelings of well-being without the intensity of caffeine's stimulation.",

      "question": "Explain the process by which theobromine is typically extracted from cocoa bean hulls.",
      "answer": "Theobromine is typically extracted from the hulls of cocoa beans left over after chocolate production. The process involves crushing the hulls and treating them with an absorbent, such as water or liquid carbon dioxide, which dissolves the theobromine. Afterward, the water or carbon dioxide is allowed to evaporate, enabling the crystallization of the pure theobromine compound.",
