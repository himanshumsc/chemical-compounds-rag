It\nnormally occurs in the form of the dodecahydrate, meaning\nthat each molecule of the compound is associated with\ntwelve molecules of water. The formula of the hydrate is\nKAl(SO4)2\u000312H2O. In this form, it occurs as white odorless\ncrystals. The compound gradually loses its water of hydration\nwhen heated, giving up the first nine molecules of water at\n64.5\u0002C (148\u0002F), and the remaining three molecules of water at\nabout 200\u0002C (392\u0002F).\nAluminum potassium sulfate belongs to a family of com-\npounds known collectively as the alums. The term alum\nrefers to a double salt that consists of aluminum, the sulfate\ngroup (SO4), and one other metal. The presence of two metals,\naluminum plus one other metal, accounts for the name dou-\nble salt. Other common alums are aluminum ammonium\nsulfate and aluminum sodium sulfate.\nS\nO\nO\nO-\nS\nO\nO\nO\n-O\nK+\nAl3+\nO-\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n53\n\nThe alums were known as far back as ancient Egypt\nand China, where they were used as deodorants. Alums are\neffective for this purpose because they are astringents, sub-\nstances that cause tissues to shrink or contract, thus redu-\ncing the tendency of sweat glands to produce perspiration.\nAs astringents, alums were also used in the field of medicine\nto treat wounds and prevent bleeding. Until the nineteenth\ncentury, however, chemists did not recognize that the sub-\nstance they knew as alum was actually a variety of different\ncompounds.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAluminum potassium sulfate occurs naturally in the form\nof the minerals alunite and kalinite. Where these minerals\nare available, the compound can be mined and purified to\nobtain potash alum. Where the minerals are not available,\nthe compound can be produced synthetically by combining\naqueous aluminum sulfate with aqueous potassium sulfate.\nThe two compounds react with each other in solution to form\nthe double salt, aluminum potassium sulfate, which can then\nbe extracted by allowing the solutions to evaporate, during\nwhich the desired compound crystallizes out.\nAluminum potassium sulfate.\nRed atoms are oxygen; yellow\natoms are sulfur; turquoise\natom is potassium; and orange\natom is aluminum.

A mordant is a substance that reacts with a dye,\nhelping it attach more permanently to a fiber or fabric.\nAluminum potassium sulfate has also been used in the\npaper-making industry for many centuries, where it has a\nvariety of applications.
