Small\namounts of impurities give it the distinctive odor of mus-\ntard, from which it gets its common name. It may also smell\nlike garlic or horseradish because of impurities.\nMustard gas was discovered by the English physicist\nFrederick Guthrie (1833–1886) in 1860. While working with\nthe compound, Guthrie spilled mustard gas on his skin and\nfound that it produced a painful red blister. That property\nhas led to the primary use of mustard gas, as a chemical\nagent used in warfare. When sprayed on a person, the com-\npound can blister the skin, burn the eyes, and irritate the\nlungs. In large doses, it can kill a person.
