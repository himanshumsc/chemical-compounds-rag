It\nresists the action of even strong solvents, such as hot con-\ncentrated sulfuric acid. The compound often occurs as a\nhydrate containing one or more molecules of water of hydra-\ntion. The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially.
