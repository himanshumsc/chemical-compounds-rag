The compound is a by-product of the\nfermentation of grape juice and, as such, may have been known\nto humans for as long as seven thousand years. An article in the\njournal Nature reported some years ago that traces of the\ncalcium salt of tartaric acid, a cousin of potassium bitartrate,\nwas found in remnants of a pottery jar in northern Iran dating\nto about 7,000 BCE. Potassium bitartrate was used by ancient\npeople in a wide range of household uses, from cooking and\nbaking to cleaning. The true chemical nature of the substance\nlong known as cream of tartar was determined in 1770 by\nthe Swedish chemist Karl Wilhelm Scheele (1742–1786).\nHOW IT IS MADE\nPotassium bitartrate is made today by the process that\nhas been used for centuries. Wine lees (the solid material left\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nO\nC\nHO\nOH\nOH\nO\nK+\n–\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n629\n\nafter grapes have been crushed to make wine) are treated\nwith hot water, which dissolves the potassium bitartrate. The\nhot solution is then allowed to evaporate. As potassium bitar-\ntrate crystals form, they are removed and purified.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of potassium bitartrate is in commercial\nfood production and household cooking and baking. The\ncompound is added to foods to stabilize egg whites after they\nhave been beaten, to add body to a product, and to produce\ncreamier textures for sugar-based foods. A small amount of\npotassium bitartrate also adds a pleasantly acidic taste to\nfoods. The compound is found most commonly in baked goods,\ncandies, crackers, confections, gelatins, puddings, jams and\njellies, soft drinks, margarines, and frostings. Some of the\nfunctions that potassium bitartrate performs in foods include:\n• It acts as a leavening agent, causing a product to rise, in\nbaked goods;\n• It serves as an anticaking agent and stabilizer to\nthicken some food products;\nPotassium bitartrate. Red\natoms are oxygen; white atoms\nare hydrogen; black atoms are\ncarbon; and blue atom is\npotassium. Gray sticks indicate\ndouble bonds.
