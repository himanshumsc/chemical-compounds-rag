In common usage,\nthe term amyl nitrite most commonly refers to the isoamyl\nform. Both isomers occur as yellowish liquids with a distinc-\ntive sweet odor and a pungent taste. They are unstable and\nbreak down when exposed to air, light, or water. Both iso-\nmers are probably best known as vasodilators, substances\nthat cause blood vessels to relax and expand, allowing an\nincreased flow of blood through the body. Because of its\nwidespread use as a hazardous recreational drug, isoamyl\nnitrite has been banned, except for specified medical uses.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nIsoamyl nitrite is prepared in a straightforward synthesis\nin the reaction between isoamyl alcohol (CH3)2CHCH2CH2OH)\nand nitrous acid (HNO2). The usual method of preparation is\nH3C C\nH\nH\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nN\nO\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n89\n\nto combine starch with concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) to\nform gaseous nitrous acid. The nitrous acid is then passed\nthrough warm isoamyl alcohol. The compound can also be\nproduced by distilling a mixture of potassium nitrite (KNO2),\nisoamyl alcohol, and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe amyl nitrites are used in medicine for the treatment\nof pain due to angina, chest pain that occurs because of the\nconstriction of blood vessels. The compounds cause the blood\nvessels to relax, expand, and ease the flow of blood, with a\nresulting decrease in chest pain. They are also used by emer-\ngency medical providers to treat poisoning by hydrogen\ncyanide and hydrogen sulfide gas. The amyl nitrites are\nconverted in the body to a compound called methemoglobin,\nwhich binds to hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide, redu-\ncing their toxic effects.\nU.S. law permits the sale of amyl nitrites as additives to\nperfumes and for other odorizing purposes. For example,\nthey may be sold as room deodorizers, to eliminate the\nAmyl nitrite. Red atoms\nare oxygen; black atoms are\ncarbon; white atoms are\nhydrogen; and the blue\natom is nitrogen.
