It is a white crystalline powder that occurs\nin nature as the mineral gibbsite, one of the three minerals\n(along with boehmite, diaspore) that makes up bauxite. Baux-\nite is a rocky material from which the metal aluminum is\nextracted commercially. Aluminum hydroxide is perhaps best\nknown to the average person as an ingredient in antacids,\ncompounds for the treatment of upset stomach, acid indiges-\ntion, and related symptoms. It is found in products such as\nMaalox\u0002, Mylanta\u0002, and Gelusil\u0002. A closely related chemical\ncompound, aluminum hydroxychloride (Al2Cl(OH)5) is the\nactive ingredient in most deodorants and anti-perspirants.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nMost aluminum hydroxide is produced by treating baux-\nite with a hot, concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide\nOH\nOH\nOH\nAl\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n45\n\n(NaOH). As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide settles\nout of the reaction mixture as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipi-\ntate, which can then be dried and saved as a white powder. The\naluminum hydroxide can also be precipitated by passing\ncarbon dioxide gas through the solution.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAluminum hydroxide is an effective antacid because it is,\nchemically, a base. As such, it reacts with stomach acid\n(hydrochloric acid; HCl), to reduce the symptoms of heart-\nburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis, an\ninflammation of the stomach lining. The compound can also\nbe used to treat peptic ulcers on a long-term basis. A peptic\nulcer is an open sore in the lining of the stomach or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nAluminum hydroxide also has a number of industrial\napplications, such as:\n• A raw material for the preparation of other aluminum\ncompounds;\n• An additive for cosmetics, paper, plastics, and rubber to\ngive the final product more bulk;\nAluminum hydroxide. Red\natoms are oxygen; white atoms\nare hydrogen; and turquoise\natom is aluminum. P U B L I S H E R S\nR E S O U R C E G R O U P\n46\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nALUMINUM HYDROXIDE\n",
