Unlike sugar, which is a carbohydrate, aspartame\nis a dipeptide, a compound made of two amino acids joined to\neach other. It is 180 to 200 times as sweet as sucrose (table\nsugar), but provides no calories to a person’s diet. It is a\nsatisfactory substitute for sugar, therefore, for people who\nmust or wish to reduce their caloric intake.\nAspartame was discovered accidentally in 1965 by James\nM. Schlatter, an employee of the G. D. Searle pharmaceutical\ncompany. Schlatter was searching for a chemical compound\nthat could be used to treat ulcers.
