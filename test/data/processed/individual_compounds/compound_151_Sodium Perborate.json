The most fre-\nquently available form of the compound, the tetraborate, is a\nwhite crystalline solid with a salty taste that melts at 63\u0003C\n(145\u0003F) and loses its water of hydration when heated above\n130\u0003C (270\u0003F). When dissolved in water, all forms of sodium\ntetraborate decompose to yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and\nsodium borate (Na2B4O7). The formation of hydrogen peroxide,\nwhich is itself unstable and breaks down to release nascent\noxygen (O), makes sodium tetraborate an excellent source of\n‘active’ oxygen. The terms nascent and active refer to individual\natoms of oxygen that have a strong tendency to react with other\nelements and compounds. Since sodium tetraborate is more\nstable than hydrogen peroxide, it can be used for the same\npurposes as the peroxide, but is safer and easier to handle.\nThe most common applications of sodium tetraborate are in\ndetergents, bleaches, hair care products, and disinfectants.\nB\nO\nO\nO-\nNa+\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n765\n\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAnhydrous sodium perborate can be made by heating the\ntetrahydrate:\nNaBO3\u00024H2O !
