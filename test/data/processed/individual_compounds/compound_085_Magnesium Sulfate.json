The heptahydrate (MgSO4\u00037H2O) is commonly\nknown as Epsom salts. All of the hydrates occur in nature as\nthe minerals, respectively, kieserite, starkeyite, pentahydrite,\nhexahydrite, and epsomite. Magnesium sulfate in all forms is\na colorless or white crystalline or powdery material with no\nodor but a bitter taste. The hydrates all lose their water of\nhydration when heated. For example, the heptahydrate loses\none molecule of water spontaneously at room temperature,\nfour molecules of water when heated above 70\u0002C (160\u0002F), six\nmolecules of water at 150\u0002C (300\u0002F), and all seven molecules of\nwater above 200\u0002C (400\u0002F).\nMagnesium sulfate heptahydrate has been known and\nused since the late seventeenth century.
