Paul Hogan (1919–) and\nRobert Banks (1921–1989). Phillips began selling polypropy-\nlene in 1951 under the trade name of Marlex\u0002.\nMuch of the early research on polypropylene was con-\nducted by the Italian chemist Giulio Natta (1903–1979), then\nan employee at the Italian chemical firm of Montecatini.\nWhile working earlier on the development of a related com-\npound, polyethylene, Natta discovered some of the funda-\nmental principles that governed the successful commercial\nproduction of polymers.

Polymerization is the process by\nwhich a single monomer unit (propylene in this case) is\nadded to a second monomer of the same kind. The procedure\nis then repeated over and over again.

If polymerization is allowed to proceed on\nits own, some methyl groups will extend in one direction\nfrom the main chain, and others in a different direction.\nThe product of this reaction is an amorphous product, one\nwithout crystalline shape, that has only a few very limited\nuses. To produce crystalline polypropylene, with all the desir-\nable properties noted above, polymerization must be con-\ntrolled to make sure that all methyl groups are on the same\nside of the main chain. One of Natta and Ziegler’s great\ncontributions was the discovery of catalysts capable of\nachieving the correct orientation of methyl groups. They\nfound that metal halides, such as titanium chloride, could\nproduce this effect.
