The compound is almost\nuniversally known in chemistry laboratories and industrial\napplications by its common name of acetone.\nAcetone was apparently first prepared in 1610 by the\nFrench alchemist Jean Be´guin (c. 1550–c. 1650). Be´guin\nobtained acetone by heating lead acetate (also known as\nSaturn’s salt) to a high temperature. He obtained a sweet-\nsmelling, very flammable liquid that he named ‘‘burning\nspirit of Saturn.’ One of the first uses to which the substance\nwas put was as a solvent in the extraction of the active\nconstituents of opium. In 1833, the French chemist Antoine\nBussy (1794–1882) gave the compound its modern name of\nacetone.

It is used as\na solvent for paints, varnishes, lacquers, inks, glues, rubber\ncements, fats, oils, waxes, and various types of rubber and\nplastics. It is perhaps best known to the average person as\nthe primary ingredient in nail polish remover. The largest\nsingle use of the compound is as a raw material in the\nmanufacture of other organic chemicals, such as chloroform,\nDimethyl ketone.
