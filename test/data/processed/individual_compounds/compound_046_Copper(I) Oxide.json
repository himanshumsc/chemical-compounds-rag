It does\nnot burn and is stable in dry air. In moist air, it slowly changes to\ncopper(II) oxide (CuO). The compound has been used by humans\nfor thousands of years, first as a pigment in glazes, and later in\nfungicides, electronic components, and industrial reactions.\nIn 1883, copper(I) oxide was the first substance found to\nhave semiconducting properties.

Copper(I)\noxide can also be made synthetically by exposing copper\nmetal to a high concentration of oxygen at an elevated\ntemperature.

For example, electrolysis of\na solution of sodium chloride using copper electrodes results\nin the formation of copper(I) oxide.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nCopper(I) oxide is used as a pigment in porcelain glazes\nand stained glass.
