The members of this family\nare made by reacting phosgene (COCl2) with any compound\nhaving two phenol structures. Phenol is hydroxybenzene,\nC6H5OH. The most common polycarbonate is made in the\nreaction between phosgene and bisphenol A (C6H5OHC(CH3)2-\nC6H5OH). Polycarbonates are sold under a number of trade\nnames, including Cyrolon\u0002, Lexan\u0002, Markrolon\u0002, Merlon\u0002,\nTuffak\u0002, and Zelux\u0002.\nPolycarbonates are strong, lightweight plastics that are\nresistant to heat, light, chemicals, and physical shock.
