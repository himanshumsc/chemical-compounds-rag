It\nabsorbs moisture from the air to become the hydrated form,\nmagnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2\u00036H2O). A deliques-\ncent substance is one that takes on moisture from the air,\noften to the extent of dissolving in its own water of hydra-\ntion. Magnesium chloride is an important industrial chemi-\ncal, used in the production of magnesium, textile and paper\nmanufacture, and cements; in refrigeration and fireproofing;\nand as a deicing agent.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nMagnesium chloride is extracted from seawater or brine,\nof which it is a component, and from minerals, such as carnal-\nlite (KCl\u0003MgCl2\u0003H2O) and bischofite (MgCl2\u00036H2O). The usual\nprocedure is to treat seawater, brine, or the mineral with lime\n(CaO), calcined dolomite (CaO\u0003MgO), or caustic soda (sodium\nMg++\nCl–\nCl–\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n411\n\nhydroxide; NaOH) to make magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2],\nwhich is then treated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to recover\nmagnesium chloride, which is usually obtained as the crystal-\nline hexahydrate. The pure compound is also produced by\nheating the double salt, magnesium ammonium chloride\n(MgCl2\u0003NH4Cl\u00036H2O), which first loses its water of hydration\nto form the anhydous double salt (MgCl2\u0003NH4Cl). With further\nheating, the ammonium chloride sublimes, leaving behind\npure anhydrous magnesium chloride.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe largest single use of magnesium chloride is in the\nproduction of magnesium metal. The metal is obtained\nthrough the electrolysis of molten magnesium chloride in a\nprocess developed by the American chemist and inventor\nHerbert Henry Dow (1866–1930) in 1916. The Dow process is\nstill the primary method used for the production of magne-\nsium metal. Other commercial and industrial uses of magne-\nsium chloride include:\n• In the manufacture of disinfectants;\n• In the fireproofing of steel beams, wooden panels, and\nother materials;\n• As a component of fire extinguishers;\n• In the manufacture of so-called Sorel cement, a mixture\nof magnesium chloride and magnesium oxide, also\nknown as oxychloride cement;\n• As a binder to control dust on dirt roads;\n• As a deicing compound;\nMagnesium chloride\nhexahydrate.
