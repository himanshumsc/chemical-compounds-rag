Its many different forms can be\nclassified as crystalline, amorphous, or vitreous. In crystalline\nforms of silicon dioxide, all of the atoms that make up the sub-\nstances are arranged in orderly patterns that have the shape of\ncubes, rhombohedrons, or other geometric figures. In amorphous\nsilicon dioxide, silicon and oxygen atoms are arranged randomly,\nwithout any clear-cut pattern. Vitreous silicon dioxide is a glassy\nform of the compound that may be transparent, translucent, or\nopaque.
