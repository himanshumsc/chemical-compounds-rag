It is a\nyellowish oily, liquid with a sweet taste and a cinnamish odor\nresponsible for the characteristic taste and odor of cinnamon\nspice. It occurs naturally in the bark of the cinnamon tree,\nCinnamomum zeylanicum, which is native to Sri Lanka and\nIndia, and has been cultivated in other parts of the world,\nsuch as Brazil, Jamaica, and Mauritius. Cinnamaldehyde is\nalso found in other members of the the Cinnamomum spe-\ncies, including cassia and camphor.\nThe molecular formula for cinnamaldehyde was deter-\nmined in 1834 by the French chemists Jean Baptiste Andre´\nDumas (1800–1884) and Euge`ne Melchior Pe´ligot (1811–1890),\nalthough its structural formula was deciphered only in 1866\nby the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825–1909).\nPrimary uses for Cinnamaldehyde are as a food flavoring\nand a medical herb.
