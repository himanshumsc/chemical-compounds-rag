Milk of mag-\nnesia was invented in 1817 by the Irish pharmacist Sir James\nMurray (1788–1871). Murray built a plant to produce a mix-\nture of magnesium hydroxide in water that he sold for the\ntreatment of a variety of ailments, including heartburn,\nstomach acidity, bladder and bowel problems, and ‘‘female\nproblems.’’ He said that the liquid mixture was much more\neffective than powdery magnesium hydroxide which had\npreviously been used for the same purposes.\nIn 1880, New York chemist Charles Henry Phillips\n(1820–1882) invented the name ‘‘milk of magnesia’’ and\nopened his own factory for producing the product.
