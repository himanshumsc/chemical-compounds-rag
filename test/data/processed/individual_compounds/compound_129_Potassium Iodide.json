In one procedure, elemental iodine (I2) is\nadded to a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH): I2 + 6KOH\n! 5KI + KIO3 + 3H2O. The potassium iodide formed is sepa-\nrated from the potassium iodate (KIO3) by fractional crystal-\nlization. That is, the solution is warmed and then cooled. As\nthe temperature falls, the two compounds, potassium iodide\nand potassium iodate, crystalize out at different tempera-\ntures and can be separated from each other. The potassium\niodate can then be heated, causing it to decompose and make\nadditional potassium iodide: 2KIO3 ! 2KI + 3O2.\nK+\nI-\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n651\n\nPotassium iodide can also be produced by reacting\nhydriodic acid (HI) with potassium bicarbonate: HI + KHCO3\n!

A mixture of iodine in aqueous potassium iodide called\nSSKI has long been used as a disinfectant.
