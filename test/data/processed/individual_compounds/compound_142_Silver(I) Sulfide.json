It is also used in the process\nknown as niello, first used by the early Greeks and Romans\nto produce a black, metallic inlay on the surface of pottery.\nSilver(I) sulfide is an irritant to the skin, eyes, and\nrespiratory system. No long-term effects of exposure to the\ncompound have been reported.
