Theo-\nbromine is structurally very similar to caffeine, which differs\nonly in the presence of a methyl group (-CH3) on one of the\nnitrogen atoms in the theobromine molecule. Both theobromine\nand caffeine belong to a family of organic compounds known as\nthe methylxanthines. Theobromine’s effects on the human body\nare similar to those of caffeine, but about ten times weaker. In\naddition, caffeine is metabolized more quickly, is addictive, and\nincreases alertness and emotional stress. It may also have ser-\nious effects on the central nervous system and the kidneys. By\ncontrast, theobromine produces feelings of well-being, is not\naddictive, has no effect on the central nervous system, and\nprovides only gentle stimulation to the kidneys.
