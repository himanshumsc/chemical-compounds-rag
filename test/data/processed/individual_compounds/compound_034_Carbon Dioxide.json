Plants use car-\nbon dioxide as a raw material to make the carbohydrates on\nwhich their structures are based. When animals eat plants,\nthose carbohydrates are then used to build and maintain\ntheir body structures.\nIn addition to its role in natural processes, carbon dioxide\nhas many commercial and industrial applications. One of the\nmost important uses is in the carbonation of beverages.\nAlthough beers and sparkling wines contain carbon dioxide\nfrom natural sources (the fermentation of sugars by\nyeasts), nearly all carbonated beverages have their carbon\ndioxide added artificially. The carbon dioxide adds a zesty\ntaste to the beverage and helps to preserve it.\nInteresting Facts\n• Carbon dioxide is the\nfourth most abundant gas\nin the atmosphere (after\nnitrogen, oxygen, and\nargon) with a concentra-\ntion of about 0.036\npercent. Researchers have\nfound that the concentra-\ntion of carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere has been\nincreasing at a regular rate\nfor at least the last forty\nyears. They believe that the\nreason for this increase is\nthe escalating use of fossil\nfuels by humans to heat\nhomes and offices; drive\ncars, trucks, trains, and\nairplanes; and to power\nindustrial operations. They\nfurther suspect that an\nincrease in the amount of\ncarbon dioxide in the\natmosphere may have sig-\nnificant long-term effects\non the planet’s climate.\n• Scientists have become\nvery interested in a form\nof carbon dioxide known\nas supercritical carbon\ndioxide (SCCO2 or SC-CO2).\nUnder the proper condi-\ntions of temperature and\npressure, carbon dioxide\n(as SCCO2) behaves as\nboth a liquid and a gas at\nthe same time. This prop-\nerty has proved to be very\nvaluable in using SCCO2 as\na highly efficient solvent\nthat has no environmental\ndisadvantages.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n179\nCARBON DIOXIDE\n",
