The\ncompound does not occur in nature because it is so soluble\nthat it is washed out of the soil by rain and surface water.\nAmmonium nitrate is stable at lower temperatures, but tends\nto decompose explosively when heated to temperatures above\n200\u0002C (390\u0002F).

Just\nover six million metric tons (6.6 million short tons) of the\ncompound were produced in 2004.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAmmonium nitrate is made commercially by passing\nammonia gas (NH3) and a water solution of nitric acid\n(HNO3) through a pipe. The ammonia combines with the\nH\nH\nH\nN\nN\nO\nO\nO\nH\n+\n-\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n73\n\nnitric acid to form ammonium nitrate. The formula for this\nreaction can be written as NH3 + HNO3 !

The\nsolution of ammonium nitrate in water is allowed to evapo-\nrate, leaving behind pure white crystals of the compound.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of ammonium nitrate is the manufac-\nture of fertilizers. In 2005, about 2 million metric tons\n(2.2 million short tons) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer was\nused in the United States. The compound is added to soil to\nprovide the nitrogen that plants need to grow. It may be used\nby itself or in combination with another nitrogen-rich com-\npound, urea, in a mixture known as UAN.\nAmmonium nitrate is also an important component of\nsome explosives. It provides the oxygen needed to cause\nsome other material to catch fire and burn very rapidly,\nAmmonium nitrate. Red\natoms are oxygen; white atoms\nare hydrogen; and blue atoms\nare nitrogen.
