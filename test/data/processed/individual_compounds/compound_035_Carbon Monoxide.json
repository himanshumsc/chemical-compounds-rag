It is one of the most common poisons in the environment\nand is responsible for thousands of deaths and hospital emer-\ngency room visits each year in the United States.

Carbon monoxide is flammable and\ncapable of forming an explosive mixture with air.\nUnder ideal circumstances, a carbon-containing fuel such\nas charcoal, natural gas, or wood burns in air to form carbon\ndioxide and water. Lacking an adequate supply of oxygen, at\nlow temperatures, or under certain other conditions, incom-\nplete combustion occurs. Incomplete combustion is a process\nin which a fuel is not completed oxidized. In such instances,\ncarbon monoxide is produced along with carbon dioxide and\nwater.

Between\n1772 and 1799, Priestley investigated the properties of car-\nbon monoxide and recognized the difference between carbon\nmonoxide and carbon dioxide. The gas was first prepared\nsynthetically by the French chemist Joseph Marie Franc¸ois\nde Lassone (1717–1788) in 1776, although he mistakenly iden-\ntified it as hydrogen. The correct chemical formula for car-\nbon monoxide was first identified by the English chemist\nWilliam Cruikshank (1745–1800) in 1800.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nA number of methods are available for the commercial\nproduction of carbon monoxide. In one procedure, air is\npassed over hot coke, graphite, or anthracite coal to make\nproducer gas, a mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monox-\nide, hydrogen, and water vapor. In a similar procedure,\nsteam is passed over hot coke or graphite to make water\ngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydro-\ngen, and nitrogen. In a third procedure, steam is mixed with\nnatural gas to form synthesis gas, consisting of carbon\ndioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. In all three proce-\ndures, the carbon monoxide component of the gas mixture\nproduced in the reaction can be separated out from the\nother gases.\nYet a fourth method for making carbon monoxide\ninvolves the partial oxidation of hydrocarbon gases obtained\nfrom natural gas or petroleum. These gases consist of carbon-\nhydrogen compounds which, when oxidized, are converted to\ncarbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. By controlling\nCarbon monoxide.
