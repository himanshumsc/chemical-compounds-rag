They both are antioxidants, which are\ncompounds that prevent oxygen from reacting with sub-\nstances and changing them into other materials. BHA and\nBHT prevent the oxidation of fats and oils that would convert\nthem into rancid, foul-smelling, harmful products.\nBHA is a white or pale yellow waxy solid with a faint\npleasant odor. BHT is a white crystalline solid. Both compounds\nare members of the phenol family of organic compounds. The\nphenols are compounds containing a benzene ring of six carbon\natoms to which is attached at least one hydroxyl (-OH) group.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nA variety of methods are available for the preparation of\nBHA. The most common method involves the reaction\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n133\n\nbetween p-methoxyphenol (CH3CH2OC6H4OH) and isobutene\n((CH3)2C=CH2) or tert,-butyl alcohol ((CH3)3COH) over a cata-\nlyst of silica (silicon dioxide; SiO2) or alumina (aluminum\noxide; Al2O3) at temperatures of about 150\u0002C (302\u0002F). BHT\nis usually made by reacting p-cresol (CH3C6H4OH) with iso-\nbutene.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe most important use of both BHA and BHT is as food\npreservatives. When these compounds are added to products\ncontaining fats or oils, oxygen reacts with the additive (BHA\nor BHT) rather than the food itself, protecting the food from\nspoiling. Among the vast array of food products containing\neither BHA or BHT or both are cereals, seasonings, frostings,\ndessertmixes,instantpotatoes,packagedpopcorn,bakedgoods,\npie crusts, meat products, potato chips, candy, sausage, freeze-\ndried meats, butter, cheese, crackers, bread, vegetable oils,\nmargarine, nuts, beer, and chewing gum.\nBoth compounds are also added to animal feed as preserva-\ntives.
