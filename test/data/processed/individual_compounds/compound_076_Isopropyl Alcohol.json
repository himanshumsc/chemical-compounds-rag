It is perhaps\nbest known to many people as rubbing alcohol, usually a 70\npercent solution of isopropyl alcohol in water. The compound\nis commonly used to clean a person’s skin before an injection\nis given. It kills bacteria on the skin and prevents infection.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most popular industrial method for preparing iso-\npropyl alcohol was invented in 1920 by researchers at the\nStandard Oil Company (now Exxon).
