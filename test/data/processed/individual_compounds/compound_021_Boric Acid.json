The compound’s solubility\nis very much a factor of temperature. In cold water, about\n5 grams (0.2 ounce) of boric acid dissolve in 100 mL\n(3.4 ounces) of water, while at 100\u0002C (212\u0002F), its solubility\nincreases to 25 grams (0.9 ounce) in 100 mL (3.4 ounces) of\nwater.\nBoric acid occurs naturally in a number of locations\nwhere it has precipitated out of hot springs.
