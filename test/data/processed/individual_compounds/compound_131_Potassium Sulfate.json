It is a colorless\nor white granular, crystalline, or powdery solid with a bitter,\nsalty taste. It occurs in nature as the mineral arcanite and in\nthe mineral langbeinite (K2Mg2(SO4)3). The compound was\nknown to alchemists as early as the fourteenth century, and\nwas analyzed by a number of early chemists, including\nJohann Glauber (1604–1670), Robert Boyle (1627–1691), and\nOtto Tachenius (c. 1620–1690).\nHOW IT IS MADE\nA variety of methods for preparing potassium sulfate is\navailable.
