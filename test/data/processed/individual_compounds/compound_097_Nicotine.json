It occurs in high concentrations in the leaves of tobacco\nplants and in lower concentrations in tomatoes, potatoes,\neggplants, and green peppers. Nicotine gets its name from\nthe tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum, which, in turn, was\nnamed in honor of the French diplomat and scholar Jean\nNicot (1530–1600), who introduced the use of tobacco to\nParis. Nicotine’s correct chemical structure was determined\nin 1843 by the Belgian chemist and physicist Louise Melsens\n(1814–1886) and the compound was first synthesized by the\nresearch team of A.
