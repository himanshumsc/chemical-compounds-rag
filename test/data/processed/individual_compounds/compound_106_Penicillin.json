The class contains a number of\ncompounds with the same basic bicyclic structure to which\nare attached different side chains. That basic structure con-\nsists of two amino acids, cysteine and valine, joined to each\nother to make a bicyclic (‘‘two-ring’’) compound. The different\nforms of penicillin are distinguished from each other by\nadding a single capital letter to their names. Thus: penicillin\nF, penicillin G, penicillin K, penicillin N, penicillin O, peni-\ncillin S, penicillin V, and penicillin X. A number of other\nantibiotics, including ampicillin, amoxicillin, and methicil-\nlin, have similar chemical structures.\nPenicillin was discovered accidentally in 1928 by the\nScottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming (1881–1995). Fleming\nnoticed that a green mold, which he later identified as\nPenicillium notatum, had started to grow on a petri dish that\nhe had coated with bacteria.

At first, Fleming saw some promise\nin this observation. Perhaps the mold could be used to kill\nthe bacteria that cause human disease. His experiments\nshowed, however, that the mold’s potency declined after a\nshort period of time He was also unable to isolate the anti-\nbacterial chemical produced by the mold. He decided that\nfurther research on Penicillium was probably not worthwhile.\nAs a result, it was not until a decade later that Penicil-\nlium’s promise was realized. In 1935, English pathologist\nHoward Florey (1898–1968) and his biochemist colleague\nErnst Chain (1906–1970) came across Fleming’s description\nof his experiment and decided to see if they could isolate the\nchemical product produced by Penicillium with anti-bacterial\naction. They were eventually successful, isolating and purifying\na compound with anti-bacterial action, and, in 1941, began trials\nwith human subjects to test its safety and efficacy (ability to kill\nbacteria). The successful conclusion of those trials not only\nprovided one of the great breakthroughs in the human battle\nagainst infectious diseases, but also won for Florey, Chain, and\nFleming the 1945 Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nPenicillins\nare\nclassified\nas\nbiosynthetic\nor\nsemi-\nsynthetic.
