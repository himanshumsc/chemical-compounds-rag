The darkening occurs because silver ions (Ag+; silver\natoms with a positive charge) are converted to neutral silver\natoms (AgO) that are dark gray in color. Silver iodide is used\nprimarily in photography and in cloud-seeding experiments.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nSilver iodide occurs naturally in the mineral odargyrite\n(also known as iodyrite), from which it can be extracted. The\ncompound is extracted by adding concentrated hydriodic acid\n(HI) to the mineral, which dissolves out the silver iodide. The\nsilver iodide can then be recovered by evaporating the solu-\ntion and purifying the product. The compound can also be\nmade more easily by reacting silver nitrate (AgNO3) with\nsodium or potassium iodide (NaI or KI) under a ruby red\nlight. The colored light is used to prevent oxidation of the\nAg\nI\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n701\n\nsilver ion to silver metal during the preparation: AgNO3 +\nNaI ! AgI + NaNO3.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of silver iodide is in photography. The\ncompound was first used for this purpose in the early nine-\nteenth century by the French experimenter Louis Jacques\nMande´ Daguerre (1787–1851). Daguerre first covered a sheet\nof copper metal with a thin layer of silver. He then exposed\nthe plate to iodine vapors, converting the silver metal to\nsilver iodide. The photograph was taken by exposing the\nplate to light, which converted colorless silver ions in silver\niodide back to grayish silver atoms. After exposure, the plate\nwas treated with magnesium vapor, which adhered to the\nparts of the plate that had been exposed to light. The\nunreacted silver iodide was then washed off the plate, reveal-\ning an image on the plate. The fundamental principle\ninvented by Daguerre is still used today in taking photo-\ngraphs with photograph film containing silver iodide.\nThe other major use for silver iodide is in cloud seeding.\nCloud seeding is the process by which some foreign mate-\nrial—usually silver iodide or dry ice (solid carbon dioxide)—is\ndropped into a rain cloud. The crystals of silver iodide or\ncarbon dioxide provide nuclei—tiny cores—on which water\ncan condense to form water droplets. The process of cloud\nseeding was first developed in the 1940s by American che-\nmist Vincent Schaefer (1927–1993). Schaefer used crushed\nSilver iodide.
