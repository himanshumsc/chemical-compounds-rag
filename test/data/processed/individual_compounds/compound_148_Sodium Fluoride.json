It is best known for its role\nin efforts to prevent tooth decay. It may be added to tooth-\npastes or mouthwashes or to municipal water supplies for this\npurpose. Although the practice of fluoridating water is now\nwidespread in the United States, it remains the subject of\ncontroversy regarding its potential health effects on humans.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nSodium fluoride occurs naturally as the mineral villiau-\nmite, although the compound is not produced commercially\nfrom that source. Some sodium fluoride is obtained as a\nbyproduct of the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers. In\nthat process, apatite (a form of calcium phosphate that also\ncontains fluorides and/or chlorides) is crushed and treated\nwith sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The products of that reaction\ninclude phosphoric acid (H3PO4), calcium sulfate (CaSO4),\nNa+\nF-\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n747\n\nhydrogen fluoride (HF), and silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4).\nThe hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride can then be\nconverted into sodium fluoride. The compound can also be\nproduced by treating hydrogen fluoride with sodium carbo-\nnate (Na2CO3):\n2HF + Na2CO3 ! 2NaF + H2O + CO2\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nMore than 50 years of research has shown that sodium\nfluoride and other fluorides are effective in preventing\ntooth decay. Based on this information, sodium fluoride or\nsome other compound of fluorine is now added to most\ntoothpastes made in the United States. Dentists regularly\ntreat their patients’ teeth with fluoride washes to make\nthem more resistant to decay. Most cities and towns in the\nUnited States add sodium fluoride or a comparable com-\npound to the municipal water supply to reduce the rate of\ndental caries (cavities). Some people who live where fluoride\nis not added to their water supply take sodium fluoride\npills to improve their dental health. The American Dental\nAssociation and the World Health Organization recommend\nSodium fluoride. Green atom\nis fluorine and turquoise atom\nis sodium.
