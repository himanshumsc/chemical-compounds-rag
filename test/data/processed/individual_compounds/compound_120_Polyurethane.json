Each form of polyurethane has its own set of physical\nand chemical properties. For example, fibers are moisture\nproof, stretchable, and resistant to the flow of electric cur-\nrent. Foams can be either rigid or flexible, with densities as\nlow as 32 kilograms per cubic meter (2 pounds per cubic foot)\nto as high as 800 kilograms per cubic meter (50 pounds per\ncubic foot). They are excellent thermal (heat) insulators.\nPolyurethane coatings are hard, glossy, flexible, readily adhe-\nsive to other surfaces, and resistant to abrasion, weathering,\nand most inorganic chemicals.

The polyurethanes\nwere first put to widespread use during World War II\nas substitutes for natural rubber in the manufacture of\ntires for military uses. The first rigid polyurethane foam\nwas made in 1940, again for military purposes; the first\npolyurethane adhesive, for the joining of rubber and glass,\nin 1941; and the first use of polyurethane as an insulator,\nin beer barrels, in 1948. Polyurethane fibers were also\nused during World War II for the manufacture of protec-\ntive clothing to be worn by soldiers in case of attacks by\npoison gas. In the late 1950s, a stretchable material made\nof polyurethane called spandex was introduced.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nPolyurethanes are formed by a reaction known as rear-\nrangement. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom from the\npolyol (alcohol with two or more hydroxyl, -OH, groups)\nleaves the polyol and attaches itself to one of the nitrogen\natoms in the diisocyanate molecule. The remnant of the\npolyol left after the hydrogen atom leaves then attaches\nitself to the carbon atom next to the nitrogen that has just\nreceived the hydrogen. The end result of this reaction is\nthat two molecules, a diisocyanate molecule and a polyol\nmolecule, have joined to make a single molecule. But that\nmolecule has the same general structure as the original\nPolyurethane. Red atoms\nare oxygen; white atoms\nare hydrogen; black atoms are\ncarbon; and blue atoms are\nnitrogen.

For example, poly-\nurethane foams are made by adding water and carbon dioxide\nto the molten polymer.
