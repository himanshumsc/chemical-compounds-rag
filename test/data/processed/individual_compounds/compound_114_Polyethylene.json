It is also an electrical\nnon-conductor. A thermosetting polymer is one that, once it is\nmelted and formed, can not be re-melted.

These forms of\nthe compound differ with respect to the structure of the poly-\nethylene chains and their relationship to each other. For exam-\nple, if all of the polyethylene chains are straight chains without\nbranches, they can pack together tightly forming a high den-\nsity product. By contrast, low density polyethylene consists of\nshorter chains with many side branches on them. The side\nbranches prevent adjacent polymer chains from getting too\nclose to each other. In cross-linked polyethylene, adjacent poly-\nmer chains actually form chemical bonds with each other,\nholding them in a regular, almost crystalline pattern.\nH\nH\nH\nH\nn\nC\nC\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n579\n",
