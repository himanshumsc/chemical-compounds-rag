It belongs to a large\nfamily of magnesium silicates that occur in nature. Magne-\nsium silicates contain at least one magnesium ion and one or\nmore silicate (SiO3) ions, and often contain one or more\nmolecules of water of hydration. Other members of the\nfamily include magnesium metasilicate (MgSiO3), magne-\nsium\northosilicate\n(Mg2SiO4),\nmagnesium\ntrisilicate\n(Mg2Si3O8),\nand\nmagnesium\ntrisilicate\npentahydrate\n(Mg2Si3O8\u00035H2O).\nThe naturally-occurring form of magnesium silicate\nhydroxide is called talc, a soft mineral that feels waxy and\nsoapy to the touch. This characteristic has led to another\nname for the mineral: soapstone.

It has a numer-\nical rank of 1 on the Mohs scale of minerals. The Mohs scale\nranks minerals from the softest (1 = talc) to the hardest\n(10 = diamond). Talc is so soft that it can be scratched with\nthe fingernail. The mineral has a pearly luster and may come\nin a variety of colors, ranging from white gray, or silver to\nblack, brown, pink, or green. Color variations depend on\nimpurities in the mineral.\nMagnesium silicate hydroxide normally occurs as a fine\nwhite powder with no odor, insoluble in most solvents, non-\ncombustible, resistant to heat, and with a tendency to absorb\nmoisture from the air.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe magnesium silicates are obtained from natural\nsources, such as talc (magnesium silicate hydroxide), ensta-\ntite (magnesium metasilicate), forsterite (magnesium ortho-\nsilicate), meerschaum (magnesium trisilicate), or serpentine\n(Mg3Si2O7). In all cases, extraction of the desired compound\nMagnesium silicate. Red\natoms are oxygen; turquoise\natom is magnesium; and orange\natom is silicon.

Talcum powder is used directly as a skin\ntreatment, especially for babies, primarily as a moisture\nabsorbent and for soothing the skin. It is also used in a\nnumber of cosmetic products, including blushes, eye sha-\ndows, make-up foundations, and face powders. Talc is also\nused widely as an additive to give products a smoother tex-\nture. Some products in which it is found include paints,\nrubber products, roofing materials, ceramics and insecti-\ncides. Other applications of talc include:\n• As a food additive to prevent foods from clumping and\nsticking together;\n• In the polishing of rice;\n• In the production of olive oil to improve the product’s\nclarity;\n• For countertops in chemical laboratories;\n• As a lubricant between sheeted products, such as parti-\ncleboard, to prevent individual sheets from sticking to\neach other;\n• As a filler in a number of products, including soap,\nputty, plaster, oilcloth, and rubber products; and\n• As a non-caking agent in animal feeds and fertilizers.\nInteresting Facts\n• The magnesium silicates\ncontain three of the eight\nmost abundant elements\nin Earth’s crust: oxygen\n(the most abundant\nelement), silicon (the\nsecond most abundant\nelement), and magnesium\n(the eighth most abundant\nelement).\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n425\nMAGNESIUM SILICATE HYDROXIDE\n",
