Mixtures differ from compounds in a number of\nimportant ways. The parts making up a mixture are not\nchemically combined with each other, as they are in a com-\npound. Also, mixtures have no definite composition, but\nconsist of varying amounts of the substances from which\nthey are formed.\nPetrolatum\nis\na\ncomplex\nmixture\nof\nhydrocarbons\nderived from the distillation of petroleum. Hydrocarbons\nare compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. The\nhydrocarbons that make up petrolatum belong to the\nmethane (saturated or alkane) family of hydrocarbons with\nthe general formula CnH2N+2. Some members of the family\ninclude methane (CH4), ethane (C2H5), propane (C3H8), and\nbutane (C4H10).\nPetrolatum occurs in a semi-solid or liquid form. The\nsemi-solid form is also called petroleum jelly or mineral jelly\nand is commercially available under a number of trade\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n547\n\nnames, including Kremoline, Pureline, Sherolatum, and\nVaselineTM. It ranges in color from white to yellowish to\namber. It is practically odorless and tasteless. It melts over a\nwide range, from about 38\u0002C to about 55\u0002C (100\u0002F to 131\u0002F).\nThe liquid form is also known as liquid paraffin, mineral\noil, or white mineral oil. Such products are sold commer-\ncially under trade names such as Alboline, Drakeol, Frigol,\nKremol, and Paroleine. It is a colorless, tasteless, and odor-\nless oily liquid.\nOil was first discovered in the United States in the 1850s\nin western Pennsylvania. A chemist from Brooklyn, New\nYork, Robert Augustus Chesebrough (1837–1938), visited\nthe new wells and noticed a wax-like material sticking\nto the petroleum drilling rods. He learned that oil workers\nused the ‘‘rod wax’’ to heal burns on their skin. Chesebrough\neventually extracted and purified the substance—petrolatum—\nfrom petroleum and began manufacturing it in 1870. He\nreceived several patents for his discovery and in 1878, he\ngave his product the trade name of VaselineTM. His product\nquickly became popular as an ointment for wounds and\nburns. Unlike the animal and vegetable oils then being used\nfor that purpose, petrolatum did not spoil. By the late 1870s,\nVaselineTM was selling at the rate of one jar every minute in\nthe United States. In 1880, it was added to the U.S. Pharma-\ncopoeia, a manual that lists drugs used in medical practice.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nPetrolatum is a product of the fractional distillation of\ncrude oil. Crude oil is a complex mixture of hundreds or\nthousands of compounds. These compounds can be separated,\nor distilled, from each other by heating crude oil to high\ntemperatures. As the temperature of the crude oil rises,\nvarious groups or a ‘‘fraction’’ of compounds boil off. The first\ngroup of compounds includes gaseous compounds dissolved\nin crude oil. The next group of compounds includes com-\npounds with low boiling points. The next group of com-\npounds includes compounds with slightly higher boiling\npoints. And so on. Eventually, a tar-like mass of compounds\nwith very high boiling points is left behind in the distilling\ntower. This residue is heated to separate liquids from solids\nremaining behind. Some of these liquids and solids make up\nthe semi-solid and liquid forms of petrolatum.\n548\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nPETROLATUM\n\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nPetrolatum has a wide variety of uses, ranging from\npersonal care and medical applications to industrial uses.\nThe solid form, such as VaselineTM is used as a topical oint-\nment for the treatment of dry, cracked skin and to reduce the\nrisk of infection. It works as a moisturizing agent because it\nreduces water loss from the skin, It helps prevent infection\nbecause it creates a barrier over wounds that prevents dis-\nease-causing organisms from entering the body. Solid petro-\nlatum is also an ingredient in many skin care and cosmetic\nproducts, such as skin lotions, body and facial cleansers, anti-\nperspirants, lipsticks, lip balms, sunscreens, and after-sun\nlotions. In hair products, it helps smooth frizzy hair by\nallowing hair to retain its natural moisture. The formation\nused in most of these products remains virtually unchanged\nfrom that developed by Robert Chesebrough in the 1800s.\nSolid petrolatum is also used in industrial applications\nfor a variety of purposes, such as:\n• As a softener in the production of rubber products;\n• In the food processing industry, to coat raw fruits and\nvegetables and to help products retain moisture;\n• As a defoaming agent in the production of beet sugar\nand yeasts;\n• For the lubrication of firearms and machine parts;\nInteresting Facts\n• Both solid and liquid\npetrolatum are available\nin three grades, known as\nUSP (U.S. Pharmacopoeia),\nNF (National Formulary),\nand FCC (Food Chemicals\nCodex).\n• A synthetic version of\npetrolatum is made from\nsoybean oil as an alterna-\ntive to petroleum-based\npetrolatum.
