Mosquitoes, for example, carry diseases\nsuch as malaria, one of the most serious diseases in the world,\nresponsible for an estimated three millions deaths a year;\nencephalitis, an infection that causes inflammation and\nswelling of the brain; and West Nile virus, an organism that\naffects the central nervous system and poses a serious threat\nto both humans and other animals.
