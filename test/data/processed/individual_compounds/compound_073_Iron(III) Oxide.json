In the most popular method, iron(II) sulfate is\nreacted with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to produce iron(II)\nhydroxide [Fe(OH)2]. The iron(II) hydroxide is then allowed\nto react with oxygen in the air, forming iron(III) oxide.\nThe compound can also be produced by heating iron(II) sul-\nfate, hydrated iron(II) oxide (FeO(OH)), or iron(III) oxalate\n[Fe2(C2O3)3].\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nIron(III) oxides has been associated with the manufac-\nture of iron and steel for much of human history. The Iron\nAge, which began in Egypt around 4000 BCE was the period\nin human history when iron was used for tools and weap-\nons. The general approach to refining iron metal from iron\nores, such as hematite, was to heat the ore in the presence\nof carbon. Carbon removes oxygen from the ore, leaving\nthe free metal behind. By the first century BCE in China,\nthe first known blast furnaces were in use. In a blast\nfurnace, iron(III) oxide is reduced with carbon by using a\nblast of air and heat. The oxygen from the air reacts with\ncarbon to give carbon monoxide, which then reacts with\niron(III) oxide to produce liquid iron metal and carbon\ndioxide.\nIn the eighteenth century, the blast furnace process\nwas further developed so that iron could be made commer-\ncially.
