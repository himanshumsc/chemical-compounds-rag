It is one of a family of compounds, the\ntocopherols, that makes up vitamin E. Other members of the\nfamily include the beta (b), gamma (g), delta (d), and epsilon\n(E) tocopherols. All tocopherols share the same basic molecu-\nlar structure, differing only in slightly different arrange-\nments of methyl (CH3-) and hydroxyl (OH-) groups. In terms\nof biological activity, a-tocopherol is the most important\nmember of the tocopherol family. The tocopherols are all pale\nyellow, viscous oils found in a variety of plants, including\nalmonds, mustard greens, green and red peppers, spinach,\nand sunflower seeds. The most important source for the\nvitamin is wheat germ.\nVitamin E was discovered in 1922 by two scientists at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, Herbert McLean Evans\nC\nC\nC\nO\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nHO\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nH3C\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nHH\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n37\n\n(1882–1971) and Katherine Scott Bishop (1889–1976).

Scientists are now\naware that the primary function of vitamin D in the human\nbody is as an antioxidant. An antioxidant is a substance that\nreacts with and prevents the harmful effects of chemical\nstrictures known as free radicals.

Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active.
