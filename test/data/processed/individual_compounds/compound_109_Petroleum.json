Alkanes are hydrocarbons in which carbon\nand hydrogen are bonded to each other by single bonds. In\nalkenes, at least one double bond is present.

In aromatic hydrocarbons, the carbon atoms are\njoined to each other in a ring that has alternate single and\ndouble bonds. Many of the hydrocarbons in petroleum also\nhave side chains that also consist of carbon and hydrogen\natoms.\nThe physical properties of petroleum vary somewhat,\ndepending on the source from which it comes and its compo-\nsition. Generally, it is a thick, oily liquid that is dark yellow\nto brown to greenish-black in color, with a strong, unpleasant\nodor.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nScientists believe that petroleum was formed about 300\nmillion years ago. When microscopic plants and animals that\nlived in the ocean died and sank to the bottom, they were\ngradually covered and compressed with more layers of\norganic material along with sand and mud. As the mud grew\nthicker, it created pressure on the organic material, causing\nit to become increasingly warmer. The heat and pressure\ncaused the organic matter to decay in the absence of oxygen,\nconverting it into petroleum and natural gas.\nOver time, the primitive oceans dried up. The sand and\nmud that had accumulated on the ocean floors changed into\nrock. The natural gas and liquid petroleum that had formed\non the ocean floor was trapped in the rock. It flowed through\ncracks in the rock until it reached porous rock that acted like\na sponge and soaked up the petroleum and natural gas. These\nfossil fuels remain trapped in the porous rock by non-porous\nlayers of rock that act like caps or seals on the porous rocks.\nGeologists have discovered a number of ways of finding\nthese oil- and gas-soaked reservoirs. They measure changes in\nthe Earth’s magnetic field and use electronic ‘‘sniffers’’ that\ncan detect hydrocarbons trapped in rock. Once oil is found,\nprospectors extract it by drilling into the porous rock. The\npressure of gases within the porous rock pushes petroleum\nup to the surface, where it can be captured and stored.\nLiquid petroleum has no commercial value as it comes\nfrom the earth. After it is captured from wells, therefore, it\nhas to be refined, or separated into usefulcomponents. Refining\nis a process by which petroleum is heated to high temperatures\nin a tall cylindrical tower. The many different hydrocarbons\n554\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nPETROLEUM\n\nin petroleum boil off and rise upward in the tower. The\nhigher they rise, the more they cool off.\nEach hydrocarbon eventually reaches a height at which it\nchanges back to a liquid. Traps are inserted at various\nheights in the tower to catch each hydrocarbon as it changes\nback to a liquid. One level of traps, for example, catches\nhydrocarbons that condense to a liquid between about 40\u0002C\nand 170\u0002C (100\u0002F and 340\u0002F). This ‘‘fraction’’ is called the\ngasoline or petrol fraction of petroleum. Another level of\ntraps catches hydrocarbons that condense between tempera-\ntures of about 170\u0002C and 250\u0002C (340\u0002F and 480\u0002F). This\ngroup of hydrocarbons is called the kerosene fraction. The\nother major fractions obtained from petroleum are the diesel\nand fuel oil fractions. Anything that boils above about 400\u0002C\n(750\u0002F) is referred to as the residual oil fraction.

In aromatic hydrocarbons, the carbon atoms are\njoined to each other in a ring that has alternate single and\ndouble bonds. Many of the hydrocarbons in petroleum also\nhave side chains that also consist of carbon and hydrogen\natoms.\nThe physical properties of petroleum vary somewhat,\ndepending on the source from which it comes and its compo-\nsition. Generally, it is a thick, oily liquid that is dark yellow\nto brown to greenish-black in color, with a strong, unpleasant\nodor.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nScientists believe that petroleum was formed about 300\nmillion years ago. When microscopic plants and animals that\nlived in the ocean died and sank to the bottom, they were\ngradually covered and compressed with more layers of\norganic material along with sand and mud. As the mud grew\nthicker, it created pressure on the organic material, causing\nit to become increasingly warmer. The heat and pressure\ncaused the organic matter to decay in the absence of oxygen,\nconverting it into petroleum and natural gas.\nOver time, the primitive oceans dried up. The sand and\nmud that had accumulated on the ocean floors changed into\nrock. The natural gas and liquid petroleum that had formed\non the ocean floor was trapped in the rock. It flowed through\ncracks in the rock until it reached porous rock that acted like\na sponge and soaked up the petroleum and natural gas. These\nfossil fuels remain trapped in the porous rock by non-porous\nlayers of rock that act like caps or seals on the porous rocks.\nGeologists have discovered a number of ways of finding\nthese oil- and gas-soaked reservoirs. They measure changes in\nthe Earth’s magnetic field and use electronic ‘‘sniffers’’ that\ncan detect hydrocarbons trapped in rock. Once oil is found,\nprospectors extract it by drilling into the porous rock. The\npressure of gases within the porous rock pushes petroleum\nup to the surface, where it can be captured and stored.\nLiquid petroleum has no commercial value as it comes\nfrom the earth. After it is captured from wells, therefore, it\nhas to be refined, or separated into usefulcomponents. Refining\nis a process by which petroleum is heated to high temperatures\nin a tall cylindrical tower. The many different hydrocarbons\n554\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nPETROLEUM\n\nin petroleum boil off and rise upward in the tower. The\nhigher they rise, the more they cool off.\nEach hydrocarbon eventually reaches a height at which it\nchanges back to a liquid. Traps are inserted at various\nheights in the tower to catch each hydrocarbon as it changes\nback to a liquid. One level of traps, for example, catches\nhydrocarbons that condense to a liquid between about 40\u0002C\nand 170\u0002C (100\u0002F and 340\u0002F). This ‘‘fraction’’ is called the\ngasoline or petrol fraction of petroleum. Another level of\ntraps catches hydrocarbons that condense between tempera-\ntures of about 170\u0002C and 250\u0002C (340\u0002F and 480\u0002F). This\ngroup of hydrocarbons is called the kerosene fraction. The\nother major fractions obtained from petroleum are the diesel\nand fuel oil fractions. Anything that boils above about 400\u0002C\n(750\u0002F) is referred to as the residual oil fraction. In many\ncases, each of the fractions obtained by this process can be\nfurther refined to separate it into even smaller fractions.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nBy far the most common use of petroleum is as gasoline\nfor automobiles and trucks. About 90 percent of the petro-\nleum used in the United States fuels vehicles powered by\ninternal combustion engines. Diesel fuel is used to power\ntrucks, buses, trains, and some automobiles. Heating oil\nwarms buildings and powers industrial boilers. Utilities use\nresidual fuel oil to generate electricity. Jet fuel, produced\nfrom kerosene, powers airplanes. Some airplanes use aviation\nInteresting Facts\n• The United States uses by\nfar more petroleum than\nany other nation in the\nworld. It uses about 1,000\nbillion liters (250 billion\ngallons) every year.\nAbout half that amount\nis imported from other\ncountries, primarily in\nthe Middle East.\n• The average fuel economy\nof automobiles produced\nin the United States has\ndecreased steadily since\n1985.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n555\nPETROLEUM\n",
