It is used almost exclusively as an anti-\nmicrobial agent—a substance that kills microorganisms such\nas bacteria and fungi. Triclocarban is available under a num-\nber of trade names, including Cusiter\u0002, Cutisan\u0002, Genoface\u0002,\nProcutene\u0002, Solubacter\u0002, and TCC\u0002. The compound is an\ningredient in deodorant soaps, disinfectants, toothpastes,\nand other household products. It is also used in hospitals to\ncleanse and disinfect the skin of patients and medical staff.\nIt remains on surfaces for relatively long periods of time,\nlengthening the disinfecting action, rather than breaking\ndown fairly quickly like many other disinfectants. Triclocar-\nban can be imbedded in plastics and textiles to create\nlong-lasting antimicrobial surfaces, such as in toys and kitch-\nenware. It is sometimes used in combination with triclosan, a\nsimilar antimicrobial agent.\nTriclocarban works as a disinfectant because it disables\nan enzyme called enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase, or\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nN\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nO\nN\nC\nC\nC\nC\nCl\nCl\nCl\nC\nC\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n859\n\nENR, that many bacteria and fungi use to make cell\nmembranes. If they cannot make cell membranes, these\nmicroorganisms die. Humans do not have this enzyme, so\ntriclocarban is considered harmless to them. The use of tri-\nclocarban became more widespread after another popular\nantimicrobial, hexachlorophene, was banned by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration in the 1970s. Hexachlorophene use\nwas discontinued after the antimicrobial was implicated in\nthe death of infants who had been exposed to the product. In\nthe first years of the twenty-first century, triclocarban and\ntriclosan began to be used less, due to increased concerns\nabout the long-term effects of these compounds on the\nhuman body and on the environment.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nTriclocarban is synthesized by one of two procedures. In\none, 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate (ClC6H4NCO) is reacted with\n3,4-dichloroaniline (C6H3NH2Cl2) to give triclocarban. The\nrelationship of these two compounds to the structure of\nthe final product (C6H3Cl2NHCONHC6H4Cl) is obvious from\ntheir chemical structures. In the second method of prepara-\ntion 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate (Cl2C6H3NCO) is reacted\nwith\n4-chloroaniline\n(ClC6H4NH2)\nto\ngive\nthe\ndesired\nproduct.\nTriclocarban.

Research has shown,\nhowever, that washing one’s hand with plain soap and water\nprovides as much protection from disease-causing organisms as\ndoantimicrobialsoaps.Itisapparentlytheactionofwashingthat\nremoves most bacteria. Many public health experts say that anti-\nmicrobial soaps are not necessary in normal healthy households.\nThe growing concern is that the widespread use of anti-\nmicrobial soaps may cause harmful bacteria and fungi to\nbecome resistant to antimicrobial agents such as triclocarban\nand triclosan. That could happen if the genes in microorgan-\nisms that produce the enzyme ENR mutate, that is, change\ntheir chemical structure. Bacteria carrying the new gene\nmight be more resistant to antimicrobial compounds.\nTriclocarban has been shown to cause contact dermatitis,\nan allergic skin rash caused by contact with an irritating\nsubstance. This effect is of particular concern among infants\nand small children. The compound has been implicated in\nillnesses among newborns, and its use in maternity wards is\ndiscouraged. However, the compound is effective in treating\nother forms of skin rashes, such as atopic dermatitis, also\nknown as eczema, because it kills the bacteria that cause the\ncondition. Although the effects of ingesting triclocarban\nhave not been thoroughly investigated, there is some ques-\ntion about the compound’s possible carcinogenic effects.\nInteresting Facts\n• Hunters sometimes wash\ntheir clothes in detergents\nthat contain triclocarban\nto kill the bacteria that\ncontribute to body odor.
