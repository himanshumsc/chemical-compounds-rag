One of the earliest mentions of\nsodium chloride dates to 2,700 BCE in the Chinese book Peng\nTzao Kan Mu, probably the first book on pharmacology ever\nwritten. Access to salt resources has often been a conten-\ntious issue among peoples, leading to battles and wars over\nits ownership. It has been considered at times to be so\nvaluable that it was used as a form of money. Today, sodium\nchloride has a host of applications beyond its use as a food\nadditive.\nNa+\nCl-\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n735\n\nHOW IT IS MADE\nSodium chloride occurs naturally as the mineral halite\nand abundantly in the oceans, where it is found in seawater\nat an average concentration of about 2.6 percent. There are\nseveral methods for harvesting salt, some of which date to\nancient times. The earliest known method of production is\nalso the simplest: evaporation of seawater by the Sun. In this\nmethod, seawater is collected in large, shallow ponds and\nallowed to evaporate. The salts dissolved in the water crystal-\nlize on the bottom of the ponds and can be scraped off and\nthe individual compounds present—including sodium chlor-\nide—separated from each other.\nThis method works best in hot, arid parts of the world. In\ncooler, moister regions, seawater must be collected in large\ncontainers that can be heated artificially. In many cases, the\nseawater is heated under reduced pressure to allow it to boil\nat a lower temperature and save heating costs. Again, crys-\ntals of sodium chloride (and other dissolved salts) form as the\nwater boils away.\nPerhaps the most important source of sodium chloride is\nsalt mines, large underground reserves of sodium chloride\nleft behind when ancient seas dried up and were buried by\nthe accumulation of rocks and soil. Salt mines are found in\nmany parts of the world, especially Russia, Germany, the\nUnited Kingdom, India, France, Mexico, Canada, and the\nUnited States. These mines often span many kilometers and\nSodium chloride. Turquoise\natom is sodium and green atom\nis chloride.

One of the most famous salt\nmines in the United States is located under the city of\nDetroit. It contains more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) of\nunderground roads built to remove blocks of sodium chlor-\nide, some as wide as four-lane highways. The Detroit mine\nceased production in 1983 when lower salt prices and result-\ning lower profits were no longer able to sustain the costs of\nextraction. The Detroit mine was reopened in 1988, but only\nfor the mining of road salt.\nTwo methods of mining are used to remove sodium chlo-\nride from underground sources. In the room-and-pillar method,\nshafts are dug into the deposit. Drilling and blasting are then\nused to break off pieces of sodium chloride, which are removed\nfor processing. As mining progresses, large pillars of salt are\nleft standing to support the empty chambers. Thus the name:\nroom-and-pillar. A second method of salt removal is solution\nmining. A well is drilled into the ground and flooded to create a\nsaturated solution of sodium chloride, a brine solution. The\nbrine is then pumped to the surface and processed.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nProbably the best known use of sodium chloride is as a\nfood additive. The Salt Institute estimates that humans con-\nsume an average of 16 tons of salt during their lifetimes. Salt\nhas long been used on foods to improve flavor and also as a\npreservative. Salted foods last longer than unsalted foods\nbecause salt inhibits the growth of microorganisms that\ncause decay.\nStill, the most important use of sodium chloride by far is\nas a raw material in the production of other compounds. In\n2004, 65 percent of all the sodium chloride consumed in the\nUnited States was used in the production of sodium hydroxide,\nsodium carbonate, hydrogen chloride, sodium metal, chlorine\ngas, and other chemical products. The next most important\nuse of sodium chloride is in water conditioners. The compound\nis used in such devices because the sodium in sodium chloride\nwill replace the calcium and magnesium in ‘hard’ water (water\nin which it is hard to make suds).
