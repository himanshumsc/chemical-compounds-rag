The compound is often called simply\nSBS or SBS rubber. A thermoplastic polymer is one that\ncan be converted back and forth between liquid and solid\nstates by alternate heating and cooling. A copolymer is a\npolymer made from two monomers, in this case, styrene\n(C6H5CH=CH2) and 1,3-butadiene (CH2=CHCH=CH2). The term\nblock copolymer means that one section of the polymer\nchain consists of polystyrene (-[CH2CHC6H5-]n to which is\nconnected another section consisting of polybutadiene\n(-[-CH2CH=CHCH2-]n), which, in turn, is connected to another\nsection of polystyrene (-[CH2CHC6H5-]n), and so on.\nA copolymer like SBS has properties of both polymers of\nwhich it is composed.
