Coal tar is a brown to black thick liquid formed\nwhen soft coal is burned in an insufficient amount of air. It\nconsists of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, similar to\nthat found in petroleum. Kidd’s extraction of naphthalene\nwas of considerable historic significance because it demon-\nstrated that coal had other important applications than its use\nas a fuel. It could also be utilized as the source of chemical\ncompounds with a host of important commercial and indus-\ntrial uses.
