The decahydrate (Na2B4O7\u000210H2O) is\nalso referred to as borax. Borax also occurs without water of\nhydration and in that form is known as anhydrous borax.\nSome historians think that borax may have been known\nas long as 4,000 years ago. Since ancient people did not use\nthe term, however, there is considerable doubt as to the\nauthenticity of these claims. The compound was certainly\nin use as far back as about 800 BCE when the compound was\nbeing used in the Chinese and Islamic civilization for making\nglass and in jewelry work. The substance was very expensive,\nhowever, and it was not widely used in Europe until the\nMiddle Ages. Borax became more commonly used after exten-\nsive deposits of its naturally occurring form were found in\nthe United States.
