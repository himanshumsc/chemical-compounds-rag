    {
      "question": "Describe the solubility properties of Potassium Bitartrate in different solvents.",
      "answer": "Potassium Bitartrate is somewhat soluble in cold water, very soluble in hot water, and insoluble in alcohol. This means it dissolves better in hot water compared to cold, and does not dissolve in alcohol.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain how Potassium Bitartrate is produced and name one of its historical uses.",
      "answer": "Potassium Bitartrate is produced by treating wine lees, the solid material left after grapes are crushed for wine, with hot water. This process dissolves the potassium bitartrate, and as the hot solution evaporates, crystals form and are then purified. Historically, it has been used by ancient people for a variety of household purposes including cooking, baking, and cleaning.",
