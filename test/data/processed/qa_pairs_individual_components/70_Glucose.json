      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of glucose, a simple sugar and a key carbohydrate in biology. Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) is a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. It is an important energy source for cells and plays a crucial role in cellular respiration. Glucose is also a building block for polysaccharides like starch and glycogen. It exists in several isomeric forms, including the open-chain and cyclic forms, with the cyclic being more common in nature.",

      "question": "How does glucose occur naturally and what are its isomeric forms?",
      "answer": "Glucose naturally occurs as a colorless to white powder or crystalline substance with a sweet flavor. It exists in two isomeric forms, known as the D configuration and the L configuration. The common name for the D conformation of glucose is dextrose.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the solubility of glucose in various solvents and its implications for biological systems.",
      "answer": "Glucose is very soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol, and insoluble in most organic solvents. This high solubility in water is significant for biological systems because it allows glucose to be easily transported in the bloodstream and utilized by cells for energy production.",
