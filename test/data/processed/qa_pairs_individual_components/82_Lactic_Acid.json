      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is lactic acid. It consists of carbon (black), hydrogen (white), and oxygen (red) atoms. Lactic acid is an organic compound with the formula C₃H₆O₃. It plays a crucial role in various biochemical processes, especially in anaerobic respiration. In muscle cells, lactic acid is produced when glucose is broken down without oxygen, often during intense exercise. It is also commonly produced through the fermentation of glucose by yeast. Lactic acid is used in food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid.",
      "answer": "D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid are isomers, meaning they have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas and properties. The D form is produced during metabolic reactions in muscle tissue, while the L form is produced by yeast cells. The orientation of one group of atoms in the enzyme used for their production differs, resulting in the two distinct isomers.",

    {
      "question": "Describe how the synthetic production of lactic acid is accomplished and what role do enzymes play in natural production.",
      "answer": "Synthetic production of lactic acid begins with the addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), forming lactonitrile (CH3CH2OCN). The lactonitrile is then hydrolyzed using a strong acid like sulfuric acid to produce lactic acid. In contrast, natural production involves enzymes: muscle cells and yeast cells use specific enzymes during anaerobic respiration and fermentation, respectively, to convert glucose into lactic acid. The enzymes differ only in the orientation of one group of atoms, leading to the production of different isomers (D and L forms).",
