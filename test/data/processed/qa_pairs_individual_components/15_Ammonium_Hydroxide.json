      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image represents ammonium hydroxide. It is formed when ammonia gas (NH₃) is dissolved in water, resulting in a solution that contains NH₄⁺ (ammonium) and OH⁻ (hydroxide) ions. Ammonium hydroxide is commonly used as a cleaning agent, in the manufacture of textiles, as a refrigerant, and as a food additive to maintain acidity. It can also be found in the production of soaps, detergents, and other industrial products. Exposure to its vapors can pose health hazards due to the release of ammonia gas.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why ammonium hydroxide does not have a melting or boiling point.",
      "answer": "Ammonium hydroxide does not have a melting or boiling point because it exists only as an aqueous solution. It is a solution of ammonia gas dissolved in water, so it does not exist in a solid or gaseous state independently, which is why these properties are not applicable.",
      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process of how ammonium hydroxide is prepared and discuss its stability.",
      "answer": "Ammonium hydroxide is prepared by passing ammonia gas (NH3) into water. This process dissolves the ammonia gas in water to form the ammonium hydroxide solution. Once prepared, the solutions of ammonium hydroxide tend to be very stable, meaning they do not readily decompose or react under normal conditions.",
