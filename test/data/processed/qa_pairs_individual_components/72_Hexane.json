      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of hexane. Hexane is an alkane with the chemical formula C₆H₁₄. It consists of six carbon atoms and fourteen hydrogen atoms. Hexane is a colorless liquid at room temperature and has a low boiling point, making it highly volatile. It is commonly used as a solvent in various industrial applications, including the extraction of vegetable oils, as a cleaning agent, and in the production of glues and inks. However, hexane poses health hazards such as respiratory issues and neurological effects if inhaled.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why hexane is considered a saturated hydrocarbon and what implications this has for its chemical structure.",
      "answer": "Hexane is considered a saturated hydrocarbon because it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms connected by single bonds, with no double or triple bonds. This classification implies that hexane is an alkane, which is a type of organic compound where all carbon atoms are fully 'saturated' with hydrogen atoms, maximizing the number of hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon skeleton.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process by which hexane is obtained from petroleum and explain why its low boiling point is significant in this process.",
      "answer": "Hexane is obtained from petroleum through fractional distillation, a process where petroleum is heated in tall towers. As a liquid with a low boiling point of 68.73°C, hexane boils off and rises to the upper levels of the tower. It then condenses and is collected as part of petroleum ether or ligroin. Its low boiling point is significant because it allows hexane to be separated from other components of petroleum based on differences in boiling points, enabling its isolation by condensation at the upper levels of the distillation tower.",
