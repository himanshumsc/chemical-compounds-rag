      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of citric acid. Citric acid is an organic compound with the formula C₆H₈O₇. It's characterized by three carboxyl groups, making it a tricarboxylic acid, and is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), which is crucial for energy production in cells. Citric acid is also known for its antioxidant properties, helping neutralize free radicals and potentially reducing damage to healthy cells. It is commonly found in citrus fruits and is used as a preservative and flavoring agent in the food industry.",
