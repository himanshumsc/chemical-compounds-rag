      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of propane, a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C₃H₈. Propane consists of three carbon atoms (black) and eight hydrogen atoms (white). It is a colorless, flammable gas at room temperature and is commonly used as a fuel for heating, cooking, and in vehicles. Propane is also a key component of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It is obtained from refining crude oil and processing natural gas. Propane is valued for its clean-burning properties and energy efficiency.",
