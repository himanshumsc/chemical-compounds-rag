      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is of ammonia (NH₃). Ammonia consists of one nitrogen atom (blue) and three hydrogen atoms (white). It is a colorless gas with a pungent smell and is highly soluble in water. Ammonia is a key compound in the nitrogen cycle and is primarily used in fertilizers. It is produced industrially via the Haber-Bosch process, which combines nitrogen and hydrogen gases under high temperatures and pressures.",

    {
      "question": "How does the Haber-Bosch process produce ammonia, and why is it significant?",
      "answer": "The Haber-Bosch process produces ammonia by combining nitrogen and hydrogen gases at high temperatures (400°C to 650°C) and pressures (200 to 400 atmospheres) over a catalyst made of finely-divided iron. This process is significant because it was developed to meet Germany's need for explosives during World War I and remains the most common method for ammonia production, allowing for large-scale production of fertilizers.",

      "question": "Discuss the role and environmental significance of ammonia in the atmosphere and its industrial applications.",
      "answer": "Ammonia was present in the primordial atmosphere of Earth and may have been a source of nitrogen for the earliest forms of life. It is also a major component of the atmosphere of many planets in our solar system. Industrially, ammonia is primarily used in the production of fertilizers, with about 90% of its use in the United States directed towards this purpose. It can be applied directly as a liquid or in various compound forms such as ammonium nitrate. The widespread use of ammonia in agriculture underscores its importance in supporting global food production. However, improper management can lead to environmental issues such as water pollution and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.",
