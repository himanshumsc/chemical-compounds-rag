      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of ethylene glycol. In the diagram, red atoms represent oxygen, white atoms are hydrogen, and black atoms are carbon. Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet-tasting liquid commonly used as an antifreeze and in the manufacture of polyester fibers and resins. It has a high boiling point and low freezing point, making it effective in preventing freezing and overheating in engines. It's also hygroscopic, meaning it can absorb water from the air.",

      "question": "Explain why ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants instead of plain water.",
      "answer": "Ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants because it raises the boiling point of the coolant. This allows airplanes to fly faster with smaller radiators without the risk of the radiator boiling over, which was a problem when using plain water.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the primary industrial method for producing ethylene glycol and discuss its efficiency.",
      "answer": "The primary industrial method for producing ethylene glycol involves the hydration of ethylene oxide. This process can be conducted at about 195°C without a catalyst or at 50°C to 70°C using a strong acid catalyst. Both methods result in a yield of at least 90 percent, making it an efficient method of production.",
