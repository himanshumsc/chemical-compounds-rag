      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown is glycerol. It consists of three carbon atoms (black), three oxygen atoms (red), and eight hydrogen atoms (white). Glycerol is a simple polyol compound commonly used in food products as a sweetener and thickener due to its moisture-retaining properties. It is also a byproduct of soap manufacturing, obtained via saponification. Additionally, glycerol can be synthesized from propylene or from simple sugars using hydrogen and a nickel catalyst.",

    {
      "question": "Why is glycerol classified as a trihydric alcohol, and what are its solubility properties?",
      "answer": "Glycerol is classified as a trihydric alcohol because its molecules contain three hydroxyl (-OH) groups. It is miscible with water and alcohol but insoluble in ether, benzene, and chloroform.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the traditional method of producing glycerol and its significance in the soap industry.",
      "answer": "The traditional method of producing glycerol is through the saponification of fats. Fats, which are esters of glycerol and alcohols, are hydrolyzed in the presence of a catalyst, converting them into glycerol and alcohols. This process is significant in the soap industry because glycerol is obtained as a byproduct, and saponification is the usual method for soap production.",
