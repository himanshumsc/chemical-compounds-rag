      "question": "Discuss the historical discovery and early experimentation of Nitrous Oxide.",
      "answer": "Nitrous oxide was likely first produced by Robert Boyle, but Joseph Priestley is credited with its discovery in 1772, naming it 'nitrous air.' Sir Humphry Davy conducted extensive experiments on the gas, noting its anesthetic properties, which led to its nickname 'laughing gas' due to the light-headedness it caused when inhaled.",
