      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a highly explosive compound that consists of carbon (black atoms), hydrogen (white atoms), nitrogen (blue atoms), and oxygen (red atoms). It is known for its use in explosives, such as dynamite, and has significant applications in construction and demolition. Additionally, nitroglycerin is used medically as a vasodilator to treat heart conditions like angina by relaxing blood vessels and improving blood flow.",

    {
      "question": "How does Nitroglycerin function as a vasodilator in medicine?",
      "answer": "In medicine, Nitroglycerin acts as a vasodilator, meaning it causes blood vessels to relax and open up. This allows blood to flow more freely through them, which can help alleviate conditions related to restricted blood flow.",

    {
      "question": "What is the primary method for synthesizing Nitroglycerin as discovered by Ascanio Sobrero, and what are the roles of the reactants?",
      "answer": "The primary method for synthesizing Nitroglycerin, developed by Ascanio Sobrero, involves adding nitric acid to glycerol with a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Nitric acid acts as the nitrating agent, converting glycerol into Nitroglycerin, while sulfuric acid serves as a catalyst to facilitate the reaction.",
