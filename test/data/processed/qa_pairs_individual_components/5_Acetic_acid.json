      "question": "Explain the role of acetic acid in the production of plastics and name two specific types of plastics that use acetic acid as a raw material.",
      "answer": "Acetic acid is used as a raw material in various chemical processes, particularly in the manufacture of plastics. Two specific types of plastics that utilize acetic acid are polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Acetic acid contributes to the chemical synthesis and structural properties of these materials.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial method developed by Monsanto for producing acetic acid and mention an alternative method that is being researched for environmental benefits.",
      "answer": "The Monsanto process for producing acetic acid involves using synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), which is heated over a catalyst made of copper and zinc oxide to produce methanol (CH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide to form acetic acid. An alternative method being researched for environmental benefits involves making acetic acid directly from methane gas (CH4) using a catalyst of palladium and sulfuric acid. This method aims to be more efficient and environmentally friendly.",
