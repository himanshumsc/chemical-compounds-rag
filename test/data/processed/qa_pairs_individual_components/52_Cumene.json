      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the molecular structure diagram is cumene. Cumene, also known as isopropylbenzene, consists of a benzene ring with an isopropyl group attached. It is primarily used as a raw material in the production of phenol and acetone. Cumene is a volatile, flammable liquid with a distinct odor and is used in various industrial applications, such as in the manufacture of plastics. It can be a skin, eye, and respiratory irritant if inhaled.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the primary industrial uses of cumene.",
      "answer": "Cumene is primarily used as a raw material in the synthesis of other organic compounds such as phenol, acetone, acetophenone, and methyl styrene. It also serves as a thinner for paints, lacquers, and enamels. The compounds derived from cumene, such as phenol and acetone, are used in the production of various plastics like polystyrene, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and polycarbonates.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction used to synthesize cumene and the alternative sources from which it can be extracted.",
      "answer": "Cumene is synthesized through a straightforward chemical reaction between benzene (C6H6) and propene (propylene; CH3CH=CH2). Additionally, it can be extracted from petroleum or from coal tar, which is the thick black material left after soft coal is converted to coke.",
