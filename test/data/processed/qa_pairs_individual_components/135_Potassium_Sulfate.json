      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of potassium sulfate (K₂SO₄). The structure includes oxygen atoms (red), a sulfur atom (yellow), and potassium atoms (turquoise). Potassium sulfate is commonly used as a fertilizer, providing essential potassium and sulfur to plants. It is particularly beneficial for crops sensitive to chloride, such as coffee, tea, and potatoes. However, it is more expensive than fertilizers that contain potassium chloride.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process of producing potassium sulfate from langbeinite and potassium chloride.",
      "answer": "Potassium sulfate can be produced from the mineral langbeinite (K2Mg2(SO4)3) by crushing and washing the mineral to separate out the double salt. This product is then treated with an aqueous solution of potassium chloride (KCl) to separate the two parts of the double salt, resulting in the formation of potassium sulfate (K2SO4) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) as by-products.",
