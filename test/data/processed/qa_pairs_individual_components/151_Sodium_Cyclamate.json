      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of sodium cyclamate. It is an artificial sweetener, specifically a salt of cyclamic acid (C₆H₁₁NHSO₃H). The key properties of sodium cyclamate include its use as a low-calorie sugar substitute in diet foods and drinks. It is often mixed with saccharin to enhance sweetness, as saccharin is about ten times sweeter. Sodium cyclamate was first marketed in 1950 and gained popularity for its use in various food products.",

    {
      "question": "Why is sodium cyclamate considered an organic salt, and what are its solubility characteristics?",
      "answer": "Sodium cyclamate is considered an organic salt because it contains a combination of an organic moiety (cyclohexyl group) and an ionic component (sodium and sulfamate group). It is soluble in water but insoluble in most organic solvents.",

    {
      "question": "How did the discovery of sodium cyclamate occur, and what is its primary use today?",
      "answer": "Sodium cyclamate was discovered in 1937 by Michael Sveda, a graduate student who noticed a sweet flavor on his cigarette while working on drug development. He identified the sweetness source as cyclamates. Today, sodium cyclamate is primarily used as an artificial sweetener, with a sweetening power about 30 times that of table sugar.",
