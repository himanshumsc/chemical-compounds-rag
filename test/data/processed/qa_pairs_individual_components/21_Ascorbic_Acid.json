      "question": "Explain why Ascorbic Acid is considered an essential vitamin for humans.",
      "answer": "Ascorbic Acid, also known as vitamin C, is considered an essential vitamin because it plays a crucial role in building collagen, a protein that serves as a support structure for the body. Since it is water-soluble and the body excretes any excess in the urine without storing it, humans need to consume it regularly in their diet. A deficiency in vitamin C can lead to scurvy, which is characterized by symptoms such as joint pain, fatigue, bleeding gums, tooth loss, slow wound healing, and bruising.",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility properties of Ascorbic Acid and the implications for its storage and consumption.",
      "answer": "Ascorbic Acid is soluble in water and alcohol but insoluble in ether, benzene, and chloroform. This property implies that it can be easily dissolved in water-based solutions, making it readily available for absorption in the human body when consumed. The solubility in water also means that it can be excreted efficiently by the body, reinforcing the need for regular intake through diet. Additionally, because it is not soluble in organic solvents like ether, benzene, and chloroform, it cannot be stored or extracted using these substances, guiding how it should be handled and preserved.",
