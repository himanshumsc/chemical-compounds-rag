      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of Naproxen. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to reduce pain, inflammation, and fever. Its structure includes the addition of a propanoyl group to 2-methoxynaphthalene. Naproxen is notable for being a chiral compound, which means it has two enantiomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. The S-enantiomer is the active form used in medications.",

      "question": "Why is Naproxen classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and what are its primary uses?",
      "answer": "Naproxen is classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) because it reduces pain, fever, and inflammation without using steroids. It inhibits an enzyme needed to produce these effects. Its primary uses are as an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever-reducing compound).",

    {
      "question": "Describe the solubility characteristics of Naproxen and explain how these properties might influence its formulation as a pharmaceutical product.",
      "answer": "Naproxen is insoluble in water but soluble in methyl alcohol and chloroform. These solubility characteristics suggest that Naproxen would not be effective in aqueous solutions, which means it might be formulated with solvents where it is soluble, such as methyl alcohol, for better delivery. Additionally, its sodium salt form is used for better gastrointestinal absorption, addressing its insolubility in water.",
