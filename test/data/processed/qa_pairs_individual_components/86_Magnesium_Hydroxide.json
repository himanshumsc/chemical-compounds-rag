      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of magnesium hydroxide. It consists of magnesium (turquoise), oxygen (red), and hydrogen (white) atoms. Magnesium hydroxide is a basic compound commonly used as an antacid, known as milk of magnesia. It reacts with stomach acid to reduce heartburn and discomfort. It's prepared by reacting magnesium chloride with sodium hydroxide or by treating seawater with lime. It forms a precipitate that settles out of solution.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the solubility and decomposition properties of Magnesium Hydroxide.",
      "answer": "Magnesium Hydroxide is virtually insoluble in water and alcohol but is soluble in dilute acids and solutions of ammonium salts. It decomposes at 350°C (660°F) rather than having a typical melting point.",
      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the process by which Magnesium Hydroxide is produced from seawater.",
      "answer": "Magnesium Hydroxide is produced from seawater by treating it with lime (calcium oxide, CaO). The seawater contains magnesium chloride (MgCl2), which reacts with the lime, resulting in the formation of Magnesium Hydroxide. The Magnesium Hydroxide then settles out of the solution as a precipitate.",
