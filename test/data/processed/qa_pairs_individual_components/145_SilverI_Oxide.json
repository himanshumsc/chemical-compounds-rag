      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is Silver(I) oxide, represented by the formula Ag₂O. It consists of silver atoms (gray) and an oxygen atom (red). Silver(I) oxide is used to give glass a yellowish cast and is a component in mixtures for polishing optical lenses. It serves as a catalyst in various industrial processes and water purification systems. However, it can be a skin, eye, and respiratory irritant and may cause serious health effects if ingested or through prolonged exposure, such as argyria.",

      "question": "How is Silver(I) Oxide typically produced?",
      "answer": "Silver(I) Oxide is produced by reacting silver nitrate (AgNO3) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH). The reaction forms silver(I) oxide (Ag2O) as a precipitate along with sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and water. The reaction can be represented as: 2AgNO3 + 2NaOH → Ag2O + 2NaNO3 + H2O.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the solubility and decomposition characteristics of Silver(I) Oxide and their implications for its use.",
      "answer": "Silver(I) Oxide is slightly soluble in water and insoluble in ethyl alcohol. It decomposes at about 200°C (400°F), which means it cannot be melted and has no boiling point. These properties make it suitable for applications where a stable solid is required at room temperature, such as polishing glass and coloring glass. However, its limited solubility and tendency to decompose at relatively low temperatures restrict its use in aqueous and high-temperature applications.",
