      "question": "Describe the color transition of Copper(II) Sulfate when it changes from its anhydrous to hydrated form and explain the significance of this property.",
      "answer": "Copper(II) Sulfate is a white crystalline powder in its anhydrous state. It most commonly occurs as the pentahydrate, CuSO4·5H2O, which is a blue granular crystalline solid. When the pentahydrate is heated, it loses its water of hydration and returns to its white, powdery anhydrous state. This color transition is significant as it is used in devices and toys that indicate the presence or absence of moisture in the air.",

    {
      "question": "Explain how Copper(II) Sulfate is produced and discuss its potential environmental hazards.",
      "answer": "Copper(II) Sulfate is produced in the laboratory and commercially by treating copper metal or one of the copper oxides (CuO or Cu2O) with sulfuric acid (H2SO4). It is used extensively in agriculture and industry due to its highly toxic character, which allows it to prevent the growth of mold, mildew, algae, and weeds. However, its use is sometimes avoided as it can have toxic effects on other plants, animals, and humans, posing potential environmental hazards.",
