      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing Potassium Fluoride from potassium carbonate and hydrofluoric acid.",
      "answer": "Potassium Fluoride can be synthesized by first dissolving potassium carbonate (K2CO3) in hydrofluoric acid (H2F2), which results in the formation of potassium bifluoride (KHF2) along with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The equation for this reaction is: K2CO3 + 2H2F2 → 2KHF2 + CO2 + H2O. The potassium bifluoride is then heated to form potassium fluoride (KF) and hydrogen fluoride (HF): KHF2 → KF + HF.",
