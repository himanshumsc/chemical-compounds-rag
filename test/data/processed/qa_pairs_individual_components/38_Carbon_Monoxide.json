      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows carbon monoxide (CO). It consists of one carbon atom (black) and one oxygen atom (red) connected by a triple bond. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is highly toxic to humans and animals when inhaled, as it interferes with oxygen transport in the blood. It is produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels and is used industrially as a reducing agent and in the production of chemicals like methanol.",

    {
      "question": "Why is carbon monoxide considered a toxic gas and what conditions lead to its formation?",
      "answer": "Carbon monoxide is considered a toxic gas because it is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and can bond to hemoglobin in the bloodstream 200 times as efficiently as oxygen, which prevents oxygen from being transported in the body. It forms under conditions of incomplete combustion, which occur when there is an inadequate supply of oxygen, low temperatures, or certain other conditions, leading to the production of carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide and water.",

    {
      "question": "Describe one method of commercial production of carbon monoxide and its industrial application.",
      "answer": "One method of commercial production of carbon monoxide involves passing steam over hot coke or graphite to produce water gas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. The carbon monoxide can be separated from the mixture for use. One major industrial application of carbon monoxide is in the synthesis of organic compounds, such as the Fischer-Tropsch reactions where carbon monoxide is reduced with hydrogen to produce various organic compounds containing oxygen.",
