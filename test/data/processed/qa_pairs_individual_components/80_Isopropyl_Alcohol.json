      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure in the image represents isopropyl alcohol (also known as isopropanol or 2-propanol). It is a colorless, flammable liquid with a strong odor. The structure shows carbon (black atoms), hydrogen (white atoms), and oxygen (red atom). \n\nKey properties of isopropyl alcohol include its ability to dissolve a wide range of non-polar compounds. It is commonly used as a solvent in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, a disinfectant, and a cleaning agent. Isopropyl alcohol is volatile and evaporates quickly, making it useful for applications requiring rapid drying.",
