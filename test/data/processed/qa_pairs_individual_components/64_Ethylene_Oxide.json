      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown is ethylene oxide. It consists of a three-membered ring with two carbon atoms (black) and one oxygen atom (red). Key properties include:\n\n1. **Reactivity**: Ethylene oxide is highly reactive due to the strained ring structure.\n2. **Uses**: Primarily used in the production of ethylene glycol, which is a precursor to antifreeze and plastics. It is also used to synthesize ethoxylates and ethanolamines for detergents.\n3. **Production**: Made via direct oxidation of ethylene gas, using a silver catalyst at 200°C to 300°C.",

      "question": "Explain the industrial methods used to produce ethylene oxide and the main differences between them.",
      "answer": "Ethylene oxide was originally produced by the chlorhydrin process, which involves reacting ethylene chlorhydrin with an inorganic base like sodium hydroxide. However, this method has largely been replaced by the direct oxidation of ethylene gas, which is more efficient. The direct oxidation takes place over a silver catalyst at temperatures between 200°C and 300°C. Despite a slightly lower yield than the chlorhydrin process, the direct oxidation method is favored because it avoids the waste of chlorine.",

      "question": "Discuss the primary industrial uses of ethylene oxide and the potential hazards associated with its handling.",
      "answer": "Ethylene oxide is primarily used in the manufacture of ethylene glycol, which is a key ingredient in antifreeze and is also used to produce plastics. About 60 percent of ethylene oxide is used for this purpose. It is also used to make higher glycols and in the synthesis of ethoxylates and ethanolamines, which are important for producing synthetic detergents. However, ethylene oxide is very unstable and highly flammable, posing significant explosion risks, thus requiring careful handling.",
