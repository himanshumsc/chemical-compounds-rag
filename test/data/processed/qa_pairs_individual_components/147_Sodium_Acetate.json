      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of sodium acetate trihydrate. Sodium acetate is composed of sodium (Na), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms. In the diagram, red atoms are oxygen, white atoms are hydrogen, black atoms are carbon, and the turquoise atom is sodium. Sodium acetate is commonly used in the textile industry as a mordant and for fabric stabilization. It can be converted to its anhydrous form by heating to remove water molecules.",

      "question": "Explain the process of how sodium acetate is prepared using sodium hydroxide and acetic acid.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is prepared by reacting sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with acetic acid (HC2H3O2). The chemical reaction is as follows: NaOH + HC2H3O2 → NaC2H3O2 + H2O. In this reaction, sodium acetate is formed along with water. The sodium acetate initially forms as a trihydrate and is recovered by evaporating the reacting solution.",

      "question": "Discuss why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and describe its physical properties that make it suitable for this application.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is used in the textile industry as a mordant in the dyeing of fabrics and to stabilize and improve the finish of fabrics. Its suitability for these applications is due to its physical properties: it is a colorless, odorless crystalline solid that is very soluble in water, making it easy to apply and remove during the dyeing process. Additionally, sodium acetate's hygroscopic nature means it readily absorbs moisture, which can be beneficial in maintaining the desired consistency and quality of the fabric finish.",
