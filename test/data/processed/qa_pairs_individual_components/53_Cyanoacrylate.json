      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is of cyanoacrylate. Key properties of cyanoacrylate include:\n\n1. **Strong Adhesive**: Cyanoacrylate is a powerful adhesive that bonds quickly to a variety of surfaces upon contact with moisture.\n\n2. **Fast-Acting**: It polymerizes rapidly, forming strong bonds almost instantly, which is why it's commonly used in \"super glues.\"\n\n3. **Medical Use**: Initially developed for military purposes, it was later approved for medical applications, such as sealing wounds.\n\n4. **Components**: It comprises carbon (black), hydrogen (white), nitrogen (blue), and...",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process and significance of cyanoacrylate polymerization in adhesive applications.",
      "answer": "Cyanoacrylate polymerization occurs when the ester reacts with water, forming polymers that bond materials together. This reaction happens quickly, allowing cyanoacrylate to be used in products like Super GlueTM to create strong bonds almost instantaneously. This property makes it valuable for applications requiring rapid adhesion.",
