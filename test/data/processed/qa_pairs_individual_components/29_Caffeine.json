      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant belonging to the class of alkaloids known as methylxanthines. It is commonly found in coffee, tea, and chocolate and is known for temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. The structure includes carbon (black), hydrogen (white), nitrogen (blue), and oxygen (red) atoms. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, which prevents the onset of drowsiness.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the physical state and solubility characteristics of caffeine based on the given information.",
      "answer": "Caffeine is a solid that appears as a fleecy white crystalline material, often in the form of long, silky needles. It is slightly soluble in water and alcohol, but soluble in chloroform. Caffeine usually exists as a monohydrate (C8H10N4O2·H2O) and loses its water of hydration easily when exposed to air.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the significance of caffeine's melting and sublimation points and how these properties might affect its practical use.",
      "answer": "Caffeine has a melting point of 238°C (460°F) and begins to sublime at about 90°C (190°F). This means that caffeine transitions directly from a solid to a gas at relatively low temperatures, which can be significant in its extraction and purification processes. The sublimation property may be utilized in industrial or laboratory settings to separate caffeine from other compounds without decomposing it, which is particularly useful in decaffeination processes and the production of pure caffeine for pharmaceuticals.",
