      "question": "Why was 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, also known as ibuprofen, developed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication?",
      "answer": "2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid was developed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication because researchers at the Boots Company discovered that its carboxylic acid (-COOH) group was responsible for anti-inflammatory properties, similar to those found in aspirin. After testing more than 600 compounds, ibuprofen was identified as being twice as effective as other compounds due to this functional group.",

      "question": "Given that 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point, what implications does this have for its storage and use in pharmaceutical applications?",
      "answer": "Since 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point of 76°C (169°F), it must be stored in a way that prevents it from reaching temperatures that would cause decomposition. This means it should be kept in a cool, controlled environment to maintain its stability and efficacy. In pharmaceutical applications, this property necessitates careful handling and storage to ensure the compound remains effective as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication.",
