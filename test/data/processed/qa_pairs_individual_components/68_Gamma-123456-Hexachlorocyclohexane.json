      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is Gamma 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane. This compound is characterized by being non-flammable and stable in the presence of heat, light, strong acids, and carbon dioxide. It is primarily used as a pesticide in agriculture and as a treatment for head lice, scabies, and other external parasites. The compound is made by treating benzene with chlorine gas, replacing all six hydrogen atoms in the benzene ring with chlorine atoms.",
