      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown in the image is Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). It is an organic compound used primarily as a fuel additive to increase the oxygen content in gasoline. The black atoms represent carbon, the red atom is oxygen, and the white atoms are hydrogen. MTBE helps fuels burn more efficiently and cleanly, reducing emissions. It became popular in the automotive fuel industry, with production significantly increasing in the 1980s due to its effectiveness in improving combustion and reducing air pollution.",

      "question": "Explain the significance of Methyl-t-butyl Ether's azeotropic mixture with water.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl Ether forms an azeotropic mixture with water, meaning that this combination of liquids boils at the same temperature and cannot be easily separated through distillation. This property indicates the presence of a constant boiling point that is lower than that of the individual components, making separation through conventional means challenging.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the historical context and environmental impact that led to the use of Methyl-t-butyl Ether as a gasoline additive.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl Ether (MTBE) was first synthesized in the 1960s as an additive to increase the octane number of gasoline, serving as a replacement for tetraethyl lead (Pb(C2H5)4), which was phased out due to its harmful environmental and health effects. The removal of lead from gasoline began in 1973 and was largely completed by 1996. In 1990, MTBE found a new application following U.S. legislation that required gasoline to burn more cleanly, thus reducing air pollution and improving environmental quality.",
