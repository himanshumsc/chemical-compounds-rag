      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown in the image is retinol, also known as vitamin A1. It is an essential nutrient for vision, immune function, and skin health. Retinol is a fat-soluble vitamin found in animal-derived foods and is also synthesized in the body from beta-carotene found in fruits and vegetables. Its chemical formula is C\\(_{20}\\)H\\(_{30}\\)O. Retinol is characterized by its long hydrocarbon chain and a terminal hydroxyl group, which is vital for its biological activity.",

      "question": "Explain the role of Retinol in the human body and its transformation process.",
      "answer": "Retinol, also known as vitamin A, is crucial in the human body for converting light into nerve impulses in the retina of the eye, as it is transformed into retinal (C20H28O), an aldehyde. Additionally, vitamin A is essential for growth, development of tissue, and maintenance of the immune system. It is synthesized in animals through pathways involving carotenes.",
