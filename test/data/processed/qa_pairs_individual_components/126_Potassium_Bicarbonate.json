      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown is potassium bicarbonate. Key properties include:\n\n- **Composition**: Contains potassium (turquoise), carbon (black), oxygen (red), and hydrogen (white).\n- **Uses**: Serves as an antacid to relieve stomach pain and heartburn, treats potassium deficiency, and may aid in muscle and bone health.\n- **Applications**: Used as a food additive, leavening agent, and in fire extinguishers. It helps maintain acidity and provides fizz in carbonated drinks.\n- **Safety**: Generally safe, but excess can cause hyperkalemia, leading to tingling, muscle weakness, and temporary...",

    {
      "question": "Explain why Potassium Bicarbonate does not have a boiling point.",
      "answer": "Potassium Bicarbonate does not have a boiling point because it decomposes above 100°C (212°F) before it can transition into a gaseous state. As a result, instead of boiling, it breaks down into other compounds.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process of how Potassium Bicarbonate is manufactured.",
      "answer": "Potassium Bicarbonate is manufactured by passing carbon dioxide gas through an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate. The reaction can be represented by the chemical equation: K2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2KHCO3. This process results in the formation of Potassium Bicarbonate.",
