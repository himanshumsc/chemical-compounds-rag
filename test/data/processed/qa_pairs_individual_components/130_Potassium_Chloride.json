      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of potassium chloride (KCl). In the diagram, the turquoise atom represents potassium, which is positively charged, and the green atom represents chlorine, which is negatively charged. This ionic compound is formed through the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions. Potassium chloride is commonly found in sea salt deposits and is highly soluble in water, especially hot water. It is often extracted from natural ores like sylvite and carnallite.",
