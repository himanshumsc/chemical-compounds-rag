      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts the molecular structure of magnesium chloride hexahydrate. In the diagram, green atoms represent chlorine, and the turquoise atom represents magnesium. Magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) is often found as a hexahydrate (MgCl₂·6H₂O) in its crystalline form. It is commonly used in the production of magnesium metal through electrolysis, as well as in fireproofing, disinfectants, deicing, and as a binder for dust control. It can also be part of Sorel cement, which includes magnesium oxide.",

      "question": "Explain the deliquescent property of Magnesium Chloride and its transformation into a hydrated form.",
      "answer": "Magnesium Chloride is a strongly deliquescent substance, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. This property allows it to transform into its hydrated form, magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O), by taking on moisture from the environment to the extent of dissolving in its own water of hydration.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the industrial process used to produce magnesium metal from Magnesium Chloride.",
      "answer": "Magnesium metal is produced from Magnesium Chloride through a process known as electrolysis, specifically the Dow process. This involves the electrolysis of molten magnesium chloride, which was developed by Herbert Henry Dow in 1916. It remains the primary method for producing magnesium metal.",
