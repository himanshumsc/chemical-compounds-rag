      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The chemical compound shown is N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, commonly known as DEET. It's an effective insect repellent, widely regarded as the \"gold standard.\" DEET is used in various formulations like solutions, lotions, creams, gels, sprays, and towelettes. It was initially developed for military use and became available to the public in 1957. DEET works by interfering with the receptors insects use to detect human presence, effectively masking the human scent.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the process by which N,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide (DEET) repels insects and discuss its safety considerations.",
      "answer": "DEET repels insects by blocking receptors on a mosquito's antennae that help it locate carbon dioxide and lactic acid from perspiration and breath. This interferes with the insect's ability to find its prey. While DEET is generally safe when used as directed, it can cause serious health hazards if inhaled or swallowed. It may cause headaches, seizures, and brain swelling, although these are rare. DEET is absorbed through the skin and metabolized by the liver, and products containing DEET are not recommended for babies under two months.",
