      "question": "Describe the solubility properties of cyanocobalamin and its physical state.",
      "answer": "Cyanocobalamin is soluble in water and alcohol but insoluble in acetone, ether, and chloroform. It appears as dark red crystals or a red powder and is solid at room temperature. It is odorless and tasteless, and when heated, it darkens above 200°C (392°F) but does not melt further.",

      "question": "Explain the role of cyanocobalamin in the human body and the consequences of its deficiency.",
      "answer": "Cyanocobalamin, also known as vitamin B12, is crucial for the synthesis of DNA in cells and the proper functioning of red blood cells and nerves. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to pernicious anemia, characterized by smaller, fewer, and less hemoglobin-rich red blood cells. This condition can cause general weakness, nervous disorders, gastrointestinal disturbances, and, if untreated, may result in death.",
