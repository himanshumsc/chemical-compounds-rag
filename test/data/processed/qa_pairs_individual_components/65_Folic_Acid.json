      "question": "Explain the solubility characteristics of folic acid and their implications for its use in medical applications.",
      "answer": "Folic acid is very slightly soluble in water and methyl alcohol, but insoluble in ethyl alcohol and acetone. These solubility characteristics mean that folic acid can be challenging to dissolve in certain solvents, which can affect how it is formulated in medical and dietary supplements. Its slight solubility in water allows for limited use in aqueous solutions, which is important for its absorption and utilization in biological systems.",
