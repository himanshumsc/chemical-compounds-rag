      "question": "What is the chemical formula of fructose, and what elements does it contain?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula of fructose is C6H12O6. It contains the elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O).",

    {
      "question": "Explain the structural difference between fructose and sucrose.",
      "answer": "Fructose is classified as a monosaccharide, which means it consists of one ring structure. In contrast, sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it consists of two ring structures. This structural difference arises because sucrose is composed of one glucose and one fructose ring bonded together, while fructose alone has a single ring structure.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the commercial production process of fructose.",
      "answer": "Fructose is commercially produced by the hydrolysis of beet sugar or inulin, a polysaccharide found in plants like dahlias, Jerusalem artichokes, and chicory. Hydrolysis involves breaking down these materials into simpler elements by reacting them with water. After hydrolysis, the mixture is treated with lime (calcium oxide, CaO) to extract the fructose. The fructose is then refined by removing impurities that result from the preparation process.",
