      "question": "Discuss the physical state and solubility properties of phenol.",
      "answer": "Phenol is a white, crystalline solid with a characteristic odor and a sharp, burning taste. It is soluble in water, ethyl alcohol, ether, chloroform, acetone, benzene, and other organic solvents. Phenol also has a tendency to absorb moisture from the air, turning into an aqueous solution.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the historical significance of phenol and its discovery.",
      "answer": "Phenol was first observed by Johann Rudolf Glauber, who obtained it from coal tar vapors. It was later isolated by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge in 1834, who named it carbolic acid. The modern name 'phenol' was suggested by Charles Frederic Gerhardt in 1843. Phenol's discovery was significant as it highlighted the potential of coal tar as a source of valuable chemical compounds.",
