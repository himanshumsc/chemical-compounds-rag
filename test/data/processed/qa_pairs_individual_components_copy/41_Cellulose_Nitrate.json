    {
      "question": "How does the nitrogen content affect the solubility properties of cellulose nitrate?",
      "answer": "The solubility properties of cellulose nitrate vary with its nitrogen content. The 'high-nitrogen' form of cellulose nitrate is soluble in acetone but insoluble in an alcohol/ether mixture. Conversely, the 'low-nitrogen' form is soluble in both acetone and the alcohol/ether mixture.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the discovery of cellulose nitrate and its initial observation by Christian Friedrich Schönbein.",
      "answer": "Cellulose nitrate was first discovered in 1845 by Swiss-German chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein. The discovery was serendipitous; Schönbein used his wife's cotton apron to clean up spilled nitric acid in his laboratory. He noticed that the cotton reacted with the nitric acid to form a new compound that exploded when heated, releasing a puff of black smoke. This reaction led to the recognition of cellulose nitrate's potential applications.",
