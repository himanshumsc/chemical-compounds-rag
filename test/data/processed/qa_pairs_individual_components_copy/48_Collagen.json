    {
      "question": "Describe the molecular structure of collagen and the role of amino acids in its formation.",
      "answer": "Collagen has a molecular structure consisting of three rope-like strands intertwined with each other. Each strand, called tropocollagen, is a polymer made up of amino acids, primarily glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. The strands are held together by the action of vitamin C molecules. Collagen synthesis involves a complex series of reactions where amino acids, organic compounds containing carboxyl and amino groups, link to form long chains known as polypeptides. These chains intertwine to form procollagen, which is processed into collagen.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the different types of collagen and their specific roles in the body.",
      "answer": "There are at least a dozen types of collagen, each with distinct functions. Type I collagen is the most abundant, forming long strands that criss-cross spaces between cells, predominantly found in tendons, bones, and scars. Type II collagen is a key component of cartilage. Type III collagen is present in granulation tissue during wound healing. Type IV collagen forms the basal lamina, which supports skin and internal surfaces. The other types of collagen have their specific roles, contributing to the body's structural integrity.",
