      "question": "Explain why ammonium sulfate is primarily used in fertilizers.",
      "answer": "Ammonium sulfate is primarily used in fertilizers because it provides two essential nutrients that plants require for growth: nitrogen and sulfur. These elements are vital for the synthesis of proteins and other important compounds within plants.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe how ammonium sulfate is produced using gypsum, ammonia, and carbon dioxide.",
      "answer": "Ammonium sulfate can be produced by treating gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) with ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In this reaction, gypsum reacts with ammonia and carbon dioxide to generate ammonium sulfate as a product. This method is an alternative to the direct reaction of ammonia with sulfuric acid.",
