    {
      "question": "Discuss the physical state and solubility characteristics of nitric acid.",
      "answer": "Nitric acid is a colorless to yellowish liquid with an acrid odor. It is miscible with water, meaning it can be mixed in all proportions without separating. However, it decomposes in ethyl alcohol and reacts violently with most organic solvents.",

      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain why nitric acid is considered a strong oxidizing agent and describe its reaction with metals.",
      "answer": "Nitric acid is one of the strongest oxidizing agents known, meaning it readily gains electrons from other substances during a chemical reaction. It attacks almost all metals, except for gold and platinum, which are resistant to its corrosive action. This property makes it useful in various industrial and laboratory applications where oxidation is required.",
