    },
    {
      "question": "Explain why Potassium Bicarbonate does not have a boiling point.",
      "answer": "Potassium Bicarbonate does not have a boiling point because it decomposes above 100°C (212°F) before it can transition into a gaseous state. As a result, instead of boiling, it breaks down into other compounds.",
      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process of how Potassium Bicarbonate is manufactured.",
      "answer": "Potassium Bicarbonate is manufactured by passing carbon dioxide gas through an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate. The reaction can be represented by the chemical equation: K2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2KHCO3. This process results in the formation of Potassium Bicarbonate.",
