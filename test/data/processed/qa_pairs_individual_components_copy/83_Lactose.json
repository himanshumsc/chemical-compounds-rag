    {
      "question": "Describe the process of obtaining alpha-lactose monohydrate from lactose and why this form is commonly used.",
      "answer": "To obtain alpha-lactose monohydrate, lactose is dissolved in water and treated with activated carbon to remove any color. The water is then allowed to evaporate, leaving behind alpha-lactose monohydrate. This form is commonly used because it is the stable form of lactose at room temperature, making it suitable for various commercial applications, such as in baby foods and dairy products.",
