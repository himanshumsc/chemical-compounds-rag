    {
      "question": "Describe the stability and transformation behavior of Copper(I) Oxide in different air conditions.",
      "answer": "Copper(I) Oxide is stable in dry air and does not burn. However, in moist air, it slowly changes to copper(II) oxide (CuO).",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the process and precautions involved in synthesizing Copper(I) Oxide industrially from copper metal.",
      "answer": "Copper(I) Oxide can be synthesized by exposing copper metal to a high concentration of oxygen at an elevated temperature. It is crucial to prevent the copper from oxidizing completely to form copper(II) oxide. Additionally, industrial methods such as the electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution using copper electrodes can also produce Copper(I) Oxide.",
