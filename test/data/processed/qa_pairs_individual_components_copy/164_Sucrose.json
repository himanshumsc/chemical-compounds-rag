    {
      "question": "Explain why sucrose is classified as a disaccharide and how this relates to its chemical structure.",
      "answer": "Sucrose is classified as a disaccharide because it consists of two monosaccharide units: glucose and fructose. These two monosaccharides are chemically bonded together to form the disaccharide sucrose. Disaccharides are a type of carbohydrate, which are organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically with hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio. The structure of sucrose reflects this composition.",

    {
      "question": "Describe what happens to sucrose when it is heated above its decomposition point and how this process affects its physical properties.",
      "answer": "When sucrose is heated above its decomposition point of about 160°C (320°F), it begins to break down into carbon and water. This decomposition process leads to caramelization, where the sucrose molecule changes structure, resulting in a darker color and altered flavor. This is due to the formation of caramel, which occurs as the compound breaks down and reorganizes chemically, affecting its physical properties such as color and taste.",
