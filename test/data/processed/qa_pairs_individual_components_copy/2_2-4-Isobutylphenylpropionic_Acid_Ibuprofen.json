      "question": "Why was 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, also known as ibuprofen, developed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication?",
      "answer": "2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid was developed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication because researchers at the Boots Company discovered that its carboxylic acid (-COOH) group was responsible for anti-inflammatory properties, similar to those found in aspirin. After testing more than 600 compounds, ibuprofen was identified as being twice as effective as other compounds due to this functional group.",

    {
      "question": "Given that 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point, what implications does this have for its storage and use in pharmaceutical applications?",
      "answer": "Since 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point of 76°C (169°F), it must be stored in a way that prevents it from reaching temperatures that would cause decomposition. This means it should be kept in a cool, controlled environment to maintain its stability and efficacy. In pharmaceutical applications, this property necessitates careful handling and storage to ensure the compound remains effective as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication.",
