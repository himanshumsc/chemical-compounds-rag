    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process and significance of cyanoacrylate polymerization in adhesive applications.",
      "answer": "Cyanoacrylate polymerization occurs when the ester reacts with water, forming polymers that bond materials together. This reaction happens quickly, allowing cyanoacrylate to be used in products like Super GlueTM to create strong bonds almost instantaneously. This property makes it valuable for applications requiring rapid adhesion.",
