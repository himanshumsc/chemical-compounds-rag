    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Potassium Nitrate considered an oxidizing agent, and what role does it play in gunpowder?",
      "answer": "Potassium Nitrate is considered an oxidizing agent because it provides oxygen for the combustion of other materials. In gunpowder, it serves this role by supplying oxygen that allows carbon and sulfur to burn rapidly, producing gases like carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, which contribute to the explosive effect.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process by which Potassium Nitrate can be commercially produced.",
      "answer": "Potassium Nitrate can be commercially produced by reacting potassium chloride (KCl) with nitric acid (HNO3) at high temperatures. The chemical reaction is: 3KCl + 4HNO3 → 3KNO3 + Cl2 + NOCl + 2H2O. This process results in the formation of Potassium Nitrate along with chlorine gas, nitrosyl chloride, and water.",
