      "question": "Explain the structure of Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) as a block copolymer and describe the roles of its segments.",
      "answer": "Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) is a thermoplastic block copolymer consisting of repeating blocks of polystyrene and polybutadiene. The polystyrene segments provide strength and durability, while the polybutadiene segments offer flexibility. This structure allows SBS to exhibit the properties of being strong yet flexible.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the polymerization process and catalyst used in the production of Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene). Why is the reaction terminated, and how is it achieved?",
      "answer": "The polymerization process for producing Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) involves breaking the double bonds in styrene and butadiene monomers, which then join to form long polymer chains. A butyl lithium (C4H9Li) catalyst is used to initiate the reaction by breaking the initial double bonds. The reaction is terminated at a specific point to control the polymer length and properties, achieved by adding dichlorodimethylsilane (SiCl2(CH3)2), which reacts with the last monomer and prevents the addition of further monomers.",
