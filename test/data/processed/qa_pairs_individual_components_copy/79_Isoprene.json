    {
      "question": "What is the chemical formula of isoprene, and what elements does it contain?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula of isoprene is CH2=CH(CH3)CH=CH2. It contains the elements carbon and hydrogen.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why isoprene is classified as an alkadiene and as a member of the terpene family.",
      "answer": "Isoprene is classified as an alkadiene because it is an unsaturated hydrocarbon with two double bonds, as indicated by 'diene.' It is also a member of the terpene family because terpenes are compounds made of two or more isoprene units. Examples of terpenes include substances like geraniol and vitamin A, which consist of multiple isoprene units.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the environmental impact of isoprene and its role in the synthesis of other compounds in the body.",
      "answer": "Isoprene and other terpenes are known to undergo reactions in the atmosphere that contribute to the formation of pollutants such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen. This highlights its environmental impact. In the human body, isoprene is a key intermediary in the synthesis of cholesterol, illustrating its biological significance. Plants also produce isoprene, which is associated with photosynthesis and affected by environmental factors like temperature and sunlight.",
