      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of Ethyl Acetate and its implications for industrial use.",
      "answer": "Ethyl acetate is slightly soluble in water but is miscible with alcohol, ether, and benzene. This solubility profile makes it useful as a solvent in various industrial applications, as it can dissolve in both organic solvents and some aqueous solutions, facilitating its use in processes that require the mixing of these different types of compounds.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the synthetic production process of Ethyl Acetate and its natural occurrence.",
      "answer": "Ethyl acetate is synthesized by reacting acetic acid (CH3COOH) with ethanol (ethyl alcohol; CH3CH2OH) in the presence of a sulfuric acid catalyst. Naturally, it occurs in fruits, yeasts, and sugar cane, contributing to their pleasant odor and taste. This dual occurrence allows it to be both synthetically produced for industrial purposes and found naturally in certain biological sources.",
