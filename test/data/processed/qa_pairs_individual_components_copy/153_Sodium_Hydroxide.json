    {
      "question": "Explain why sodium hydroxide is considered a deliquescent solid and its implications.",
      "answer": "Sodium hydroxide is considered a deliquescent solid because it absorbs moisture from the air. This property means that sodium hydroxide can attract and absorb water vapor, which can lead to it dissolving in the absorbed moisture and potentially forming a liquid solution on exposure to air. This characteristic requires it to be stored in airtight containers to prevent it from absorbing moisture and reacting with carbon dioxide in the air to form sodium carbonate.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process by which sodium hydroxide is commercially produced and its relation to chlorine gas.",
      "answer": "Sodium hydroxide is commercially produced through the electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution. In this process, an electric current is applied to break down the sodium chloride (NaCl) into its component elements, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). The chlorine is released as a gas, while the sodium reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This process not only produces sodium hydroxide but also generates chlorine gas as a byproduct, illustrating the interconnected nature of chemical manufacturing.",
