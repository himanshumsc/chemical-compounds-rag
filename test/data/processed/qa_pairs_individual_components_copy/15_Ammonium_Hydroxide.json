    {
      "question": "What is the chemical formula for ammonium hydroxide and which elements does it consist of?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for ammonium hydroxide is NH4OH. It consists of nitrogen (N), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O).",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain why ammonium hydroxide does not have a melting or boiling point.",
      "answer": "Ammonium hydroxide does not have a melting or boiling point because it exists only as an aqueous solution. It is a solution of ammonia gas dissolved in water, so it does not exist in a solid or gaseous state independently, which is why these properties are not applicable.",
      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process of how ammonium hydroxide is prepared and discuss its stability.",
      "answer": "Ammonium hydroxide is prepared by passing ammonia gas (NH3) into water. This process dissolves the ammonia gas in water to form the ammonium hydroxide solution. Once prepared, the solutions of ammonium hydroxide tend to be very stable, meaning they do not readily decompose or react under normal conditions.",
