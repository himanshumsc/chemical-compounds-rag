    },
    {
      "question": "How is Aluminum Oxide produced from bauxite?",
      "answer": "Aluminum Oxide is produced by washing bauxite with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which produces aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). This aluminum hydroxide is then heated to drive off water, resulting in the production of Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3).",

    {
      "question": "Explain why Aluminum Oxide is suitable for use in abrasives and refractory products.",
      "answer": "Aluminum Oxide's suitability for use in abrasives is due to its hardness, being the second hardest naturally occurring mineral after diamond. This makes it effective for grinding, polishing, and smoothing materials. Its high melting point (2072°C) and low electrical conductivity make it ideal for refractory products, which require materials that do not melt easily and can withstand high temperatures.",
