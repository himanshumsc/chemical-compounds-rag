      "question": "Explain the primary use of Methyl Mercaptan and why it is important for safety in certain applications.",
      "answer": "Methyl Mercaptan is primarily used in the synthesis of other organic compounds such as pesticides, fungicides, jet fuel components, plastics, and the amino acid methionine. Additionally, it is used as an odorant due to its noticeable and offensive odor. This is important for safety because it can be added to odorless gases like propane and natural gas, making leaks detectable before they pose a fire or explosion hazard.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction process used to synthesize Methyl Mercaptan.",
      "answer": "Methyl Mercaptan is synthesized through a direct reaction between methanol (CH3OH) and hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). In this process, the hydroxyl group (-OH) from methanol combines with one hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide to form water, leaving methyl mercaptan as the major product.",
