      "topic_category": "identification"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the molecular formula of benzene and what elements does it comprise?",
      "answer": "The molecular formula of benzene is C6H6, and it is comprised of carbon and hydrogen elements.",

      "topic_category": "formula"
    },
    {
      "question": "Discuss the solubility properties of benzene and identify in which solvents it is soluble.",
      "answer": "Benzene is slightly soluble in water, meaning it does not dissolve well in it. However, it is soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol, ether, and acetone, where it dissolves more readily.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain why benzene's chemical structure was considered a mystery and how Friedrich August Kekulé contributed to understanding it.",
      "answer": "Benzene's chemical structure was mysterious because its formula, C6H6, suggests it contains three double bonds, yet it lacks typical double-bonded chemical properties. Friedrich August Kekulé proposed a solution in 1865 by suggesting a structure where the six carbon atoms form a ring with alternating single and double bonds, which accounts for benzene's unique stability.",
