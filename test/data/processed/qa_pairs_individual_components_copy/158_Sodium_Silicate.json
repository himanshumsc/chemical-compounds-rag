    {
      "question": "Describe the process of manufacturing sodium silicate.",
      "answer": "Sodium silicates are manufactured by fusing sand (silicon dioxide) and soda ash (sodium carbonate) or sodium hydroxide in a gas-fired open hearth furnace, similar to steel manufacturing. The reaction yields lumps of sodium silicate, which are broken apart and dissolved in a stream of hot steam. The sand and soda ash proportions, reaction temperature, and residual water content determine the final product's physical properties.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain how the physical properties of sodium silicate vary and identify one key factor that influences these variations.",
      "answer": "The physical properties of sodium silicate vary considerably, ranging from white powders with different water solubility levels to greenish, glass-like solids, and liquids with varying viscosities (from about 0.5 poise to over 600,000 poise). One key factor influencing these variations is the relative proportions of sodium oxide (Na2O) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) present in the compound.",
