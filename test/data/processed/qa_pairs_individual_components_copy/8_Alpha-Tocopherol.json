    {
      "question": "Explain why synthetic Vitamin E is generally less potent than natural Vitamin E.",
      "answer": "Synthetic Vitamin E is generally less potent than natural Vitamin E because it consists of two stereoisomers, while natural Vitamin E exists in only one stereoisomeric form. Stereoisomers are compounds with the same number and types of atoms but with different spatial orientations. In synthetic Vitamin E, only one of the two stereoisomers is biologically active, namely the one found in natural Vitamin E. Therefore, synthetic Vitamin E tends to be about half as biologically active as its natural counterpart.",

    {
      "question": "How does Alpha-Tocopherol function as an antioxidant, and why is this function important for human health?",
      "answer": "Alpha-Tocopherol functions as an antioxidant by reacting with and neutralizing free radicals, which are atoms or groups of atoms with a single unpaired electron, making them highly reactive. Free radicals can cause cell damage, leading to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and aging. By neutralizing free radicals, Alpha-Tocopherol helps prevent these harmful effects, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining human health.",
