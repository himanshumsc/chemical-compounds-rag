      "question": "How does zinc oxide contribute to the longevity of white paints and pigments compared to other white paint compounds?",
      "answer": "Zinc oxide contributes to the longevity of white paints and pigments by not reacting readily with hydrogen sulfide in the air, which prevents the paints from darkening. This property helps white paints and pigments retain their luster and purity longer than most other types of white paints.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the process and chemical reactions involved in the 'wet' method of producing zinc oxide.",
      "answer": "In the 'wet' method of producing zinc oxide, zinc compounds are leached out of ores and converted to basic zinc carbonate (ZnCO3·2Zn(OH)2). Leaching is a process where soluble salts are dissolved out of the soil, ore, or other materials. The basic zinc carbonate is then decomposed by heat, which yields pure zinc oxide along with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) as byproducts. The chemical reaction for this process is: ZnCO3·2Zn(OH)2 → 3ZnO + CO2 + 2H2O.",
