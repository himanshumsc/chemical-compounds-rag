      "question": "Discuss the historical and modern uses of boric acid and its potential hazards.",
      "answer": "Historically, boric acid has been used by the Greeks as an antiseptic, as well as for preserving foods and cleaning. In modern times, it is primarily used in the production of heat-resistant glass, like borosilicate glass, and as an antiseptic in eyewashes, ointments, and mouthwashes. It is also used as a pesticide and in flame retardant materials. However, boric acid is considered hazardous if it enters the body through wounds or ingestion, which led to its ban in products like talcum powders and salves for diaper rashes due to toxicity concerns.",
