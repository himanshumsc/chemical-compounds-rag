      "question": "Explain why L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester is considered a dipeptide and how it compares to sucrose in terms of sweetness and caloric content.",
      "answer": "L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester, also known as aspartame, is considered a dipeptide because it is composed of two amino acids joined together. It is 180 to 200 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar) but provides no calories, making it a suitable sugar substitute for those looking to reduce caloric intake.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the solubility characteristics of L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester and its implications for use in food products.",
      "answer": "L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester is slightly soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol, benzene, ether, and most other organic solvents. This solubility profile means that while it can be used in aqueous food products, its insolubility in organic solvents limits its use to food and beverage applications where water is the primary solvent.",
