      "question": "Explain the difference between nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, given they are both forms of niacin.",
      "answer": "Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both forms of niacin, also known as vitamin B3. The primary structural difference between the two is that in nicotinic acid, there is a hydroxyl group (-OH), while in nicotinamide, this hydroxyl group is replaced by an amino group (-NH2). Despite this difference, both forms are essential to cell metabolism.",

    {
      "question": "Describe how a diet primarily consisting of corn products can lead to pellagra, despite corn being a good source of niacin.",
      "answer": "Corn is indeed a good source of niacin. However, the niacin present in corn is chemically inactivated, which means it cannot be absorbed by the body in its natural form. This inactivation poses a risk for pellagra in populations whose diets are primarily based on corn, as they do not receive adequate niacin. To make niacin bioavailable, corn must be treated with an alkaline material, such as limestone or wood ashes, which Native Americans traditionally did, preventing pellagra. Without such treatment, the body lacks the niacin it needs, leading to pellagra.",
