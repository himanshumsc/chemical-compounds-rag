      "question": "Why is isoamyl nitrite considered unstable, and what are its effects when used medically?",
      "answer": "Isoamyl nitrite is considered unstable because it breaks down when exposed to air, light, or water. Medically, it is used as a vasodilator, which means it causes blood vessels to relax and expand, allowing for increased blood flow. This is particularly useful in treating angina and poisoning by hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide gas.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the synthesis method of isoamyl nitrite, and explain its use in emergency medical situations.",
      "answer": "Isoamyl nitrite is prepared by reacting isoamyl alcohol with nitrous acid. One common method involves generating nitrous acid by combining starch with concentrated nitric acid, then passing it through warm isoamyl alcohol. It can also be synthesized by distilling a mixture of potassium nitrite, isoamyl alcohol, and sulfuric acid. In emergency medical situations, isoamyl nitrite is used to treat poisoning by hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide gas. It converts to methemoglobin in the body, which binds to these toxic substances, reducing their harmful effects.",
