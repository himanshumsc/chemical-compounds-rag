      "question": "Explain the process of how sodium acetate is prepared using sodium hydroxide and acetic acid.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is prepared by reacting sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with acetic acid (HC2H3O2). The chemical reaction is as follows: NaOH + HC2H3O2 → NaC2H3O2 + H2O. In this reaction, sodium acetate is formed along with water. The sodium acetate initially forms as a trihydrate and is recovered by evaporating the reacting solution.",

      "question": "Discuss why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and describe its physical properties that make it suitable for this application.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is used in the textile industry as a mordant in the dyeing of fabrics and to stabilize and improve the finish of fabrics. Its suitability for these applications is due to its physical properties: it is a colorless, odorless crystalline solid that is very soluble in water, making it easy to apply and remove during the dyeing process. Additionally, sodium acetate's hygroscopic nature means it readily absorbs moisture, which can be beneficial in maintaining the desired consistency and quality of the fabric finish.",
