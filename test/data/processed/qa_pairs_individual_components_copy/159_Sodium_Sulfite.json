      "topic_category": "formula"
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the stability and solubility characteristics of Sodium Sulfite.",
      "answer": "Sodium Sulfite is stable in dry air but decomposes in moist air to produce sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethyl alcohol.",

      "topic_category": "properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process of producing Sodium Sulfite and its main industrial application.",
      "answer": "Sodium Sulfite is produced by reacting sulfur dioxide, soda ash (sodium carbonate; Na2CO3), and water to form sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3), which is then treated with excess soda ash to yield Sodium Sulfite. It is also a byproduct in the preparation of phenol (C6H5OH). The main industrial application of Sodium Sulfite is in the pulp and paper industry.",
