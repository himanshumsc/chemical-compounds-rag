      "topic_category": "identification"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the chemical formula of Silicon Dioxide and what elements does it consist of?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula of Silicon Dioxide is SiO2. It consists of the elements silicon (Si) and oxygen (O).",

      "topic_category": "formula"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the different structural forms of Silicon Dioxide and how they differ.",
      "answer": "Silicon Dioxide can exist in crystalline, amorphous, or vitreous forms. Crystalline silicon dioxide has atoms arranged in orderly geometric patterns like cubes or rhombohedrons. Amorphous silicon dioxide has atoms arranged randomly without any clear pattern. Vitreous silicon dioxide is a glassy form that can be transparent, translucent, or opaque. These forms can be converted from one to another through heating and changes in pressure.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain how silicon dioxide's solubility varies and under what conditions it can dissolve.",
      "answer": "Silicon dioxide is generally insoluble in water; however, its solubility can vary depending on its crystalline state. It is soluble in many acids and alkalis. This variation in solubility is due to the different structural forms of silicon dioxide, which affect how it interacts with solvents.",
