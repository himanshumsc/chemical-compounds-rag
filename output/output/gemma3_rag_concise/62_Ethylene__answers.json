      "question": "Explain why Ethylene is classified as an unsaturated hydrocarbon.",
      "answer": "Acetylene, also known as ethyne, is classified as an unsaturated hydrocarbon because it contains a triple bond between its carbon atoms (CH=CH). Unsaturated hydrocarbons have one or more multiple bonds (double or triple) between carbon atoms, unlike saturated hydrocarbons which only have single bonds. This triple bond signifies incomplete saturation of carbon atoms.",
