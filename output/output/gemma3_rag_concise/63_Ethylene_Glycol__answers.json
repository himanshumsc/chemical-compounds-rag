      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **ethylene glycol**. It's produced via ethylene oxide hydration at 383°F or 50-70°C. Key properties: a compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, often used as antifreeze.",

      "answer": "The provided text does not contain information about ethylene glycol production. It details acetic acid production and properties. The primary method described for acetic acid is reacting synthesis gas (CO & H2) over a copper/zinc oxide catalyst to produce methanol, then treating it with CO. Historically, fermentation of sugar/carbohydrates was used, but is not industrially efficient.",
