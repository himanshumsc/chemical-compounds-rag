      "answer": "The image depicts **Niacin**, also known as nicotinic acid. It's a vitamin (B3) involved in metabolism. Produced from tryptophan, it was crucial in addressing pellagra. It's a red compound with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms.",

      "question": "Describe how a diet primarily consisting of corn products can lead to pellagra, despite corn being a good source of niacin.",
      "answer": "Corn contains niacin (vitamin B3), but it's primarily in a bound form called nicotinamide. Historically, corn was treated with alkali (lye) during processing (nixtamalization) to release the niacin, making it bioavailable. Without this process, the body can't absorb and utilize the niacin, leading to niacin deficiency and pellagra.",
