      "question": "Explain why pectin is classified as a mixture and not a compound, and describe its chemical structure.",
      "answer": "Pectin is classified as a mixture, specifically a colloid, not a compound because it's not a chemically combined substance. It's a complex polysaccharide composed of various chains of galacturonic acid, some with methyl groups. These chains aggregate, forming a gel-like substance. Its structure involves a backbone of α-1,4-linked galacturonic acid residues with varying degrees of methyl esterification and acetylations, alongside side chains of neutral sugars.",
