      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **polystyrene**. It's a polymer made from styrene, formed by adding hydrogen atoms to double bonds. Key properties: widely used in daily life (rubber tires, etc.), discovered in 1930, and commercially available by 1937.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula and the basic structural unit of polystyrene?",
      "answer": "Polystyrene's chemical formula is (C8H8)n. Its basic structural unit is a styrene molecule (C8H8), which links together to form long polymer chains.",

      "question": "How does polystyrene demonstrate its properties as a thermoplastic polymer, and what are its implications for practical applications?",
      "answer": "Polystyrene (a polymer of styrene) demonstrates thermoplastic properties by softening and flowing when heated, then solidifying upon cooling – a reversible process. It’s mixed with polybutadiene to enhance desired qualities. Practical applications include backing on nylon carpet, appliance components, luggage, and piping, highlighting its versatility in both domestic and industrial settings.",

      "answer": "The provided text does not contain information about the polymerization of styrene or the role of polymerization initiators. It discusses Acetaminophen, Acetic Acid, Alumina, Acetylene, and other compounds, but not styrene or polystyrene. Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on this context.",
