      "answer": "Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) (SBS) is a block copolymer composed of three distinct segments: polystyrene (PS), polybutadiene (PB), and polystyrene (PS).\n\n**Structure:** It consists of long, continuous blocks of PS separated by a block of PB.\n\n**Roles:**\n\n*   **PS Blocks:** Provide hardness, strength, and rigidity.\n*   **PB Block:** Offers elasticity and flexibility due to its rubbery nature.\n\nThe combination creates a material with a balance of properties—toughness, resilience, and processability—used in adhesives, sealants, and modified asphalt.",

      "question": "Describe the polymerization process and catalyst used in the production of Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene). Why is the reaction terminated, and how is it achieved?",
      "answer": "Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) (SBS) is formed via polymerization of styrene and 1,3-butadiene. Source 2 mentions SBS was first developed by German chemists, Walter Bock and Eduard Tschunkur, in the early 1930s. While the specific catalyst isn't detailed, polymerization typically involves catalysts like Ziegler-Natta or organometallic compounds. The reaction is terminated by chain transfer agents or by simply stopping the addition of monomers, preventing further growth.",
