      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **fructose**. It's a sugar group, a carbohydrate, and a sweetener. It's refined from beet sugar and used in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). It's virtually the only important use of fructose as a sweetener and preservative.",

      "question": "Explain the structural difference between fructose and sucrose.",
      "answer": "The provided text defines monosaccharides (three to nine carbon atoms) and carbohydrates (composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen). Fructose is a monosaccharide. Sucrose is not mentioned directly, but it's implied as a carbohydrate and likely a disaccharide based on general knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the structural difference is that fructose is a single sugar (monosaccharide), while sucrose is formed from two monosaccharides linked together (disaccharide).",

      "question": "Describe the commercial production process of fructose.",
      "answer": "Acetic acid can be made by the fermentation of any material containing sugar or carbohydrates. However, this method isn't efficient enough for industrial use. The most common method involves synthesis gas (CO & H2) heated over a copper/zinc oxide catalyst to make methanol, which is then treated with carbon monoxide to produce acetic acid.",
