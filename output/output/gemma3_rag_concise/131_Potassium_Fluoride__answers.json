      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing Potassium Fluoride from potassium carbonate and hydrofluoric acid.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't detail the synthesis of potassium fluoride specifically. However, it implies potassium fluoride can be made from potassium carbonate. A likely method involves reacting potassium carbonate with hydrofluoric acid. This reaction would neutralize the carbonate, forming potassium fluoride and carbon dioxide as a byproduct.",
