      "question": "Explain the significance of Aluminum Fluoride in the production of aluminum metal and its other industrial applications.",
      "answer": "Aluminum fluoride (AlF3) is crucial in aluminum metal production. It’s a key component in the electrolytic process, forming a protective layer on the aluminum electrolyte, enabling efficient aluminum extraction from alumina (Al2O3). AlF3 is commercially made by reacting alumina trihydrate (Al(OH)3) with hydrofluoric acid (HF). Beyond aluminum production, AlF3 has diverse industrial uses, including in ceramics, glass, and as a flux in metallurgy. It is a highly stable compound resisting strong solvents.",
