      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Polypropylene. It's a polymer made by polymerizing propylene. The image shows its molecular structure with carbon, hydrogen, and black atoms. It was discovered in the 1950s and is widely used.",

      "question": "Why is polypropylene considered a thermoplastic polymer, and how does this property affect its usability?",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly state why polypropylene is a thermoplastic polymer. However, it mentions plastics like polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate as being manufactured using acetic acid, implying a broader category of plastic materials. Thermoplastic polymers, like polypropylene, can be repeatedly softened by heating and hardened by cooling, retaining their shape. This property makes them reusable and recyclable, expanding their usability in various applications where flexibility, durability, and ease of processing are required.",

      "question": "Explain the role of catalysts in the production of crystalline polypropylene and name one type of catalyst used.",
      "answer": "Catalysts are crucial in producing crystalline polypropylene, increasing the rate of polymerization without being consumed. One common type of catalyst used is a Ziegler-Natta catalyst.",
