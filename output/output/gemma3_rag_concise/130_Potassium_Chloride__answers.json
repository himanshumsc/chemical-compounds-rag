      "answer": "Based on the provided sources, information about Potassium Chloride's physical properties and solubility is not explicitly detailed. However, Source 1 states that solubility is important as most chemical reactions require reactants to be dissolved. It also mentions that water is the most common solvent for inorganic compounds. While not a direct statement about Potassium Chloride, it implies it likely dissolves well in water.",
