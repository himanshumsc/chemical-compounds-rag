      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Sodium polyacrylate. It's a polymer formed from repeating monomer units, creating a mesh-like structure. Water causes the mesh to open, and it's used in various applications due to its water-absorbing properties.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula representation of Sodium Polyacrylate?",
      "answer": "Sodium polyacrylate isn't represented by a single, simple chemical formula. It's a polymer with a variable composition. A general representation is [Na(C3H3O2)x], where 'x' indicates the repeating units and varies.",
