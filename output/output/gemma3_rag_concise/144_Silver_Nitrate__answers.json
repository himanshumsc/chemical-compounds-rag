      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly detail Silver Nitrate's solubility or behavior in light. However, it *does* state that solubility is important because most reactions occur when reactants are dissolved. The text mentions water is the common solvent for inorganic compounds, suggesting Silver Nitrate (an inorganic compound) would likely be soluble in water. No information about light sensitivity is present.",
