      "question": "Describe the color transition of Copper(II) Sulfate when it changes from its anhydrous to hydrated form and explain the significance of this property.",
      "answer": "Copper(II) sulfate (CuSO₄) transitions from a white, anhydrous form to a blue, hydrated form (CuSO₄·5H₂O) upon absorption of water. This color change is significant as it visually indicates the presence of water and the formation of the hydrate. It's a reversible process demonstrating the interaction between the compound and water molecules.",

      "answer": "Copper(II) Sulfate (CuSO₄) isn't explicitly detailed regarding production in the provided texts. However, its presence in the index (Source 4) suggests it's a listed compound.\n\nEnvironmental hazards aren't directly mentioned. The text focuses on uses and potential human health effects of various compounds, not ecological impacts. Further research beyond this dataset would be needed to address environmental concerns.",
