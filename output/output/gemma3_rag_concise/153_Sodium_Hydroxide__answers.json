      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**. It's a base, reacting with acids to reduce heartburn/indigestion. Industrially, it's used in aluminum compound production and as an additive.",

      "question": "Explain why sodium hydroxide is considered a deliquescent solid and its implications.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly state why NaOH is deliquescent. However, it mentions NaOH is used to precipitate aluminum hydroxide. This implies a solution is involved, and deliquescence is a property of solids that absorb moisture from the air to form a liquid solution. NaOH's basic nature likely contributes to this hygroscopic behavior. The implication is that NaOH readily absorbs atmospheric water, which can affect its storage and handling.",
