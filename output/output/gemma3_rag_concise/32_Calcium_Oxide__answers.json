      "question": "Explain how calcium oxide reacts with water and the implications of this reaction.",
      "answer": "Calcium oxide (CaO), also known as quicklime, reacts vigorously with water (H₂O) in a process called hydration. The reaction is: CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂. This forms calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), also known as slaked lime.\n\nThe reaction is exothermic, releasing significant heat. Implications include:\n\n*   **Construction:** Slaked lime is used in mortar and plaster.\n*   **Neutralization:** It neutralizes acidic conditions.\n*   **Industrial processes:** Used in various chemical processes.\n*   **Safety hazard:** The heat released can cause burns; caution is needed.",
