      "question": "Explain why ammonium sulfate is primarily used in fertilizers.",
      "answer": "Ammonium sulfate (listed with a molecular weight of 77) is a common fertilizer because it provides both nitrogen and sulfur, two essential nutrients for plant growth. Nitrogen promotes leaf and stem growth, while sulfur is vital for protein synthesis. It's a readily available source of these nutrients, making it effective for boosting crop yields.",
