      "question": "Explain the solubility characteristics of lactose in different solvents.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly state lactose's solubility. However, it mentions that water is the most common solvent for inorganic compounds and organic solvents (including alcohol, ether, acetone, and benzene) are common for organic compounds. Lactose is an organic compound (a disaccharide - two sugar molecules joined). Therefore, it is likely soluble in organic solvents and potentially in water, though this isn't directly confirmed.",
