      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Sodium cyclamate (C6H11NHSO3H). It's an artificial sweetener, about ten times sweeter than saccharin. It's a salt of carboxylic acid cyclamic acid and was patented in 1950.",

      "question": "Why is sodium cyclamate considered an organic salt, and what are its solubility characteristics?",
      "answer": "Sodium cyclamate is considered an organic salt because it's formed by the reaction of an organic acid (cyclamic acid) with sodium hydroxide. Salts are ionic compounds.\n\nSolubility: Sodium cyclamate is highly soluble in water.",
