      "question": "Explain the process of synthesizing Copper(II) Oxide from copper nitrate and its potential use in industry.",
      "answer": "Synthesis of Copper(II) Oxide (CuO) typically involves reacting copper nitrate with a base (like sodium hydroxide) to precipitate copper hydroxide, followed by heating to decompose it into CuO.\n\nCuO’s industrial uses stem from its properties. It’s a semiconductor, used in solar cells and electronics. It's also a catalyst in various reactions and finds application in pigments, ceramics, and as a fungicide.",
