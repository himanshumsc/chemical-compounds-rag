      "question": "Explain the concept of isomers in the context of butyl acetate and list its three isomeric forms.",
      "answer": "Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. Butyl acetate (C6H12O2) has several isomers. Three common isomeric forms include:\n\n1. **n-Butyl Acetate:** Linear butyl group.\n2. **Isobutyl Acetate:** Branched isobutyl group.\n3. **sec-Butyl Acetate:** Secondary butyl group.\n\nThese isomers exhibit different properties due to their varied structures.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial production process for butyl acetate and its primary uses.",
      "answer": "The provided text does not contain information about the industrial production process or uses of butyl acetate. It details the production and uses of acetic acid and 1,3-butadiene.\n\n\n\nAcetic acid production involves reacting synthesis gas (CO & H2) over a copper/zinc oxide catalyst or fermentation. Uses include plastics and raw materials for fungicides, adhesives, and carpet backing. 1,3-butadiene is extracted from petroleum and used in polymer manufacture, fungicides, and various industrial products.",
