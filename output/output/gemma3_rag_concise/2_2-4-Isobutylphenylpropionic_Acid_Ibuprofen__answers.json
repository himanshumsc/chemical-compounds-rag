      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid**, also known as **Ibuprofen**. It's a non-addictive pain reliever and anti-inflammatory drug, often used to treat arthritis and easier on the stomach than aspirin.",

      "question": "Why was 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, also known as ibuprofen, developed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication?",
      "answer": "Ibuprofen was developed by Boots Company researchers in the early 1960s. They were seeking carboxylic acids with anti-inflammatory properties, inspired by aspirin's action. After testing over 600 compounds, they discovered 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid (ibuprofen) met the criterion and was twice as effective as aspirin. The goal was to find a substance with similar properties but causing less stomach irritation than aspirin.",

      "question": "Given that 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point, what implications does this have for its storage and use in pharmaceutical applications?",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't mention 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid or its decomposition. It *does* discuss acetic acid, which, in concentrated form, poses health risks and requires safety precautions. While not directly relevant to the user's specific compound, the general principle is that instability (decomposition) necessitates careful storage and handling to maintain purity and prevent degradation/hazards in pharmaceutical applications.",
