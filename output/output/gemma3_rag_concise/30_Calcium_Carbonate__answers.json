      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). It's an inorganic compound used as an antacid and in agriculture to maintain soil acidity. The diagram shows a double bond and a calcium chloride (CaCl₂) reaction with sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃).",

      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly detail calcium carbonate's solubility. However, it explains that solubility is crucial as most chemical reactions require reactants to be dissolved. It states water is the common solvent for inorganic compounds. Acetone, alcohol, ether, and benzene are solvents for organic compounds.\n\n\n\nTherefore, calcium carbonate's solubility (or lack thereof) in various solvents and water would dictate its behavior and usefulness in different environments. More detailed information requires consulting other resources.",
