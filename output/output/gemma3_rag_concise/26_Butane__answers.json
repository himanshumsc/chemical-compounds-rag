      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **butane**. It's a hydrocarbon found in natural gas, liquefying at -42°C. Key properties: flammable, used as a fuel, and a component of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).",

      "question": "Explain the difference between the two isomeric forms of butane.",
      "answer": "The database doesn't directly address butane isomers. However, Source 2 mentions IUPAC names clarifying ambiguity. Isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangements. Butane (C4H10) has two main isomers: n-butane and isobutane (also called 2-methylpropane). They differ in the branching of the carbon chain. n-butane is a straight chain, while isobutane has a branched chain. This difference affects their properties like boiling point.",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility and state of butane, and its implications for its use as a fuel.",
      "answer": "Butane (not mentioned in provided sources) is a gaseous hydrocarbon at room temperature, readily soluble in organic solvents but sparingly soluble in water. Its gaseous state and high flammability make it suitable as a fuel (e.g., in lighters and portable stoves). Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) often contains butane.",
