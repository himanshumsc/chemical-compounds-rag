      "answer": "The provided text does not contain information about Carbon Tetrachloride. However, it does define **Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)** as \"A family of chemicals made up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.\" Halogenated hydrocarbons contain halogens (like chlorine and fluorine) bonded to carbon. Therefore, based on the provided definitions, a compound containing both carbon and halogens (chlorine and/or fluorine) would be classified as a halogenated hydrocarbon.",
