      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts 1,3-butadiene. It's a chemical compound used as a substitute for natural rubber. It's produced via butene cracking, yielding ethylene and 1,3-butadiene. Key properties involve double bonds (C=CH2, CH=CH2).",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula of 1,3-butadiene, and what type of compound is it?",
      "answer": "1,3-butadiene's chemical formula is not provided directly, but Source 3 shows a structural formula. It's used in the manufacture of polymers and is a raw material for fungicides. Source 2 states it's a compound with harmful effects and a potential carcinogen.",

      "question": "Explain how 1,3-butadiene is produced in the United States.",
      "answer": "In 2004, U.S. manufacturers produced 2.2 million metric tons (2.4 million short tons) of 1,3-butadiene, ranking it number 22 among all chemicals produced in the United States. The source doesn't detail *how* it's produced, only the volume.",

      "question": "Discuss the industrial uses of 1,3-butadiene and the potential hazards associated with it.",
      "answer": "1,3-Butadiene's primary industrial use is in polymer manufacturing, particularly for polystyrene-polybutadiene and other specialized copolymers. It's also used in fungicides (like Captan & Captofol), latex adhesives, and various domestic/industrial products (carpet backing, piping).\n\nPotential hazards include respiratory irritation, fatigue, dizziness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory paralysis, and death. It’s considered a carcinogen, though risks are primarily for workers with direct exposure.",
