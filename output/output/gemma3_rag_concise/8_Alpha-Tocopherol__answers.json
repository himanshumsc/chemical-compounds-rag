      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **alpha-tocopherol**, a form of Vitamin E. It's an antioxidant that protects cells from free radical damage, potentially preventing cardiovascular disease, cancer, and aging. It's synthesized and derived from natural sources.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why synthetic Vitamin E is generally less potent than natural Vitamin E.",
      "answer": "According to Source 1, synthetic Vitamin E is less potent than natural Vitamin E because natural Vitamin E exists in only one stereo isomeric form, which is very biologically active. Synthetic Vitamin E, however, consists of two stereoisomers, only one of which is biologically active, resulting in about half the activity.",

      "question": "How does Alpha-Tocopherol function as an antioxidant, and why is this function important for human health?",
      "answer": "Alpha-Tocopherol (Vitamin E) prevents oxidation (spoilage) in vegetable oils and shortening. As an antioxidant, it combats compounds that may be carcinogenic, and it's crucial for human health because it helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. It's also important for premature/young babies who may experience deficiency symptoms like muscle weakness.",
