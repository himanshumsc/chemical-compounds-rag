      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH). It's a weak base used as a cleaning agent, refrigerant, and in manufacturing textiles, soaps, and pharmaceuticals. Solutions release ammonia gas when exposed to air.",
