      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **nitroglycerin**. It's an explosive compound discovered by Alfred Nobel. Initially deemed too dangerous, it was later used in construction and mining, often combined with clay (dynamite). It has medical uses, exceeding aspirin as a popular analgesic.",

      "question": "How does Nitroglycerin function as a vasodilator in medicine?",
      "answer": "Nitroglycerin's vasodilating effect stems from its conversion to nitric oxide (NO) in the body. NO relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessel walls, widening them. This reduces the heart's workload and improves blood flow.",

      "question": "What is the primary method for synthesizing Nitroglycerin as discovered by Ascanio Sobrero, and what are the roles of the reactants?",
      "answer": "Nitroglycerin synthesis, discovered by Ascanio Sobrero, involves reacting glycerol with nitric acid. Glycerol provides the basic structure, while nitric acid contributes the nitro groups.",
