      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **sodium acetate trihydrate**. It's used in the textile industry as a mordant and stabilizer. It's prepared by heating the hydrate to drive off water. Potential hazards include irritation.",

      "question": "Explain the process of how sodium acetate is prepared using sodium hydroxide and acetic acid.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't detail the preparation of sodium acetate. However, it *does* explain how aluminum hydroxide is made, which involves a similar principle: reacting a substance with sodium hydroxide. Aluminum hydroxide is precipitated from a solution by passing carbon dioxide gas through the solution, or by adding sodium hydroxide. While not sodium acetate, this demonstrates a related chemical process.",

      "question": "Discuss why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and describe its physical properties that make it suitable for this application.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't mention sodium acetate or its use in the textile industry. It *does* discuss acetic acid, which is used in textile printing. Acetic acid's role is as an acidifier to improve oil flow from wells. It's also used in manufacturing organic compounds for packaging materials, paints, adhesives, and artificial fibers.\n\nKey properties mentioned are its production via synthesis gas and fermentation, and potential health risks in concentrated forms. It's described as being soluble in water.",
