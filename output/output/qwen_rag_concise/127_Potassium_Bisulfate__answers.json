      "question": "Discuss the properties of Potassium Bisulfate that make it suitable as a food additive and any potential hazards associated with its use.",
      "answer": "Potassium Bisulfate is a food additive due to its ability to act as a preservative, acidifier, and flavor enhancer. It is suitable for food additives because it can control pH and prevent spoilage. However, concentrations higher than 1% can produce irritation of the gastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Safety precautions are important for individuals handling the material.",
