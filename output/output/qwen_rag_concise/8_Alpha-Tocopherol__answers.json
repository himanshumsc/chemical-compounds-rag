      "question": "Explain why synthetic Vitamin E is generally less potent than natural Vitamin E.",
      "answer": "Synthetic Vitamin E consists of two stereoisomers, only one of which (the one that occurs in natural Vitamin E) is biologically active. Natural Vitamin E exists in only one stereo isomeric form, which is very active biologically. So synthetic Vitamin E tends to be about half as active biologically as natural Vitamin E, making it less potent.",

      "question": "How does Alpha-Tocopherol function as an antioxidant, and why is this function important for human health?",
      "answer": "Alpha-tocopherol functions as an antioxidant by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, which is a chain reaction involving free radicals. It donates electrons to free radicals, neutralizing them and preventing oxidative damage to cells and tissues. This function is crucial for human health as it helps protect against cellular damage from oxidative stress, reducing the risk of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and cancer.",
