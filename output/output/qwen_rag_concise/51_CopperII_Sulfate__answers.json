      "question": "Explain how Copper(II) Sulfate is produced and discuss its potential environmental hazards.",
      "answer": "Copper(II) Sulfate is produced by reacting copper metal with sulfuric acid. It is used in various industries, including as a fungicide, mordant, and dye. Potential environmental hazards include toxicity to aquatic life, soil contamination, and bioaccumulation in organisms. Handling should be done with proper safety measures due to its harmful effects on humans.",
