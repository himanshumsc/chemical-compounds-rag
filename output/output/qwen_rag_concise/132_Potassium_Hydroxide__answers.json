      "question": "Why is Potassium Hydroxide considered a deliquescent material, and what happens when it absorbs carbon dioxide from the air?",
      "answer": "Potassium Hydroxide absorbs moisture from the air, forming a hygroscopic solution, which is why it is considered deliquescent. When it absorbs carbon dioxide, it forms potassium carbonate, which is less soluble and can precipitate out, leading to the formation of a solid precipitate.",

      "question": "Explain the process by which Potassium Hydroxide is manufactured and describe its reactivity with metals in moist air.",
      "answer": "Potassium Hydroxide is manufactured by reacting potassium carbonate with sodium hydroxide in a solution. In moist air, it can react with metals such as aluminum, zinc, and iron, forming potassium metal salts and hydrogen gas.",
