      "question": "Discuss the solubility characteristics of L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester and its implications for use in food products.",
      "answer": "L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester, also known as Aspartylphenylalanine methyl ester (APM), is a synthetic amino acid. It is highly soluble in water and polar solvents due to its carboxylic acid and amino group functionalities. This solubility makes it useful in food products for enhancing flavor and improving texture, particularly in beverages and confectionery where it acts as a flavor enhancer and sweetener.",
