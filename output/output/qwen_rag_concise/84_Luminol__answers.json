      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shows Luminol, a chemical compound with key properties: emits a bluish-green glow when in contact with blood, due to the presence of iron in hemoglobin; red atoms are oxygen, white is hydrogen, black is carbon, blue is nitrogen; gray sticks indicate double bonds.",

      "question": "Explain the phenomenon that occurs when luminol is combined with hydrogen peroxide and how it relates to forensic science.",
      "answer": "When luminol is combined with hydrogen peroxide, a chemical reaction known as chemiluminescence occurs, producing a bright blue-green light. This reaction is used in forensic science for detecting blood without the need for stains, making it a key technique in bloodstain pattern analysis.",

      "question": "Discuss why the boiling point of Luminol is listed as 'not applicable' and what this indicates about its stability at high temperatures.",
      "answer": "Luminol's boiling point is not applicable because it decomposes at high temperatures. This indicates its instability at high temperatures, as it breaks down into its basic elements, rendering boiling point determination meaningless.",
