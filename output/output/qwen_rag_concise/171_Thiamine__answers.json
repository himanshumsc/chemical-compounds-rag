      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows Thiamine (Vitamin B1). It contains oxygen (red), hydrogen (white), carbon (black), nitrogen (blue), and sulfur (yellow). It's water-soluble, essential for energy metabolism, and deficiency causes beriberi.",

      "question": "Why is thiamine considered a water-soluble vitamin and what are its solubility characteristics?",
      "answer": "Thiamine, or vitamin B1, is considered a water-soluble vitamin because it dissolves easily in water. It does not accumulate in the body and is excreted in urine.",

      "question": "Explain how thiamine was discovered and its historical significance in relation to the disease beriberi.",
      "answer": "Thiamine was discovered in 1867 by Paul Ehrlich and others, who identified it as a component of yeast. It was later isolated and synthesized in 1873 by William Crookes. Thiamine is crucial for the body's metabolic processes. Its historical significance lies in its role in preventing beriberi, a disease caused by a thiamine deficiency. Beriberi was prevalent in populations consuming polished rice, which lacks thiamine. The discovery of thiamine led to its use as a vitamin supplement to combat beriberi.",
