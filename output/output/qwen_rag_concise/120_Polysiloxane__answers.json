      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows polysiloxane. It contains oxygen (red), hydrogen (white), carbon (black), and silicon (blue). Polysiloxane has different physical and chemical properties, ranging from liquid to gel to a rubber-like material. It is chemically inert and resistant to heat.",

      "question": "What elements are always present in the structure of polysiloxane, and which elements are almost always present?",
      "answer": "Polysiloxane structures always contain silicon (Si) and oxygen (O). Other common elements include hydrogen (H).",

      "question": "Explain the structural difference between a linear and a cyclic polysiloxane molecule.",
      "answer": "Linear polysiloxane molecules have a straight chain structure with alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, while cyclic polysiloxane molecules have a ring structure with the same alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, forming a closed loop.",

      "question": "How do modifications to the organosiloxane polymers influence the properties and applications of polysiloxanes?",
      "answer": "Modifications to organosiloxane polymers can influence their properties and applications by altering their structure, such as changing the silicon-oxygen ratio or introducing side chains. These changes can affect their viscosity, thermal stability, and elasticity, expanding their range of applications in coatings, adhesives, and medical devices.",
