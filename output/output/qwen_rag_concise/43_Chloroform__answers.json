      "question": "Explain why chloroform was replaced by other compounds as an anesthetic in the twenty-first century.",
      "answer": "Chloroform was replaced by other anesthetics in the 20th century due to its toxicity, including potential liver damage and carcinogenic properties. Newer compounds, like sevoflurane, were developed for their improved safety profiles and better patient outcomes.",

      "question": "Describe the commercial production process of chloroform. Include the chemical reaction involved.",
      "answer": "Chloroform is produced by the chlorination of methane. The reaction involves the substitution of a hydrogen atom in methane with a chlorine atom, forming chloromethane. This is followed by successive chlorination of chloromethane to produce chloroform.",
