    {
      "question": "Explain how the solubility of boric acid in water changes with temperature.",
      "answer": "Boric acid is slightly soluble in water. Its solubility decreases with increasing temperature. As temperature rises, boric acid becomes less soluble, leading to precipitation. This behavior is characteristic of endothermic solvation processes.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical and modern uses of boric acid and its potential hazards.",
      "answer": "Boric acid has a long history of use, particularly in traditional medicine and as a fire retardant. Modern applications include fireproofing, wood treatment, and as an insecticide. Potential hazards include skin irritation, eye damage, and respiratory issues. Concentrated forms can be corrosive and hazardous if ingested or inhaled.",
