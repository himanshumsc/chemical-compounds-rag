      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows ethylene glycol. It consists of two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms, forming a linear molecule with a molecular weight of 62 g/mol. It is used as a coolant and antifreeze in vehicles.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants instead of plain water.",
      "answer": "Ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants instead of plain water because it has a higher boiling point and lower freezing point, providing better temperature control. It also has a greater ability to dissipate heat, enhancing the cooling effect. Additionally, ethylene glycol is less corrosive than water, reducing the risk of damage to the radiator and engine.",

      "question": "Describe the primary industrial method for producing ethylene glycol and discuss its efficiency.",
      "answer": "ETHYLENE GLYCOL production primarily involves the synthesis gas (CO and H2) over a copper-zinc oxide catalyst to produce methanol, which is then treated with CO to form ethylene glycol. This method is efficient and widely used in industry.",
