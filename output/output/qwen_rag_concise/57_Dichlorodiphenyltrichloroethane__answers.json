      "question": "Discuss the solubility properties of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT).",
      "answer": "Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a lipophilic compound with high solubility in organic solvents and fats. It is poorly soluble in water but soluble in oils, fats, and organic solvents like ethanol or acetone. Due to its persistent nature, DDT can accumulate in fatty tissues and bioaccumulate in the food chain.",

      "question": "Explain how Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contributed to public health efforts during World War II.",
      "answer": "During World War II, DDT was used as an insecticide to control mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects, significantly reducing the spread of diseases like malaria and typhus, which were major health concerns. This chemical intervention contributed greatly to public health efforts by preventing the population from falling victim to these diseases.",
