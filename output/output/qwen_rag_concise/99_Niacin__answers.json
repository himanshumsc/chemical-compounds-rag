      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows niacin (vitamin B3). It has a chemical structure with oxygen (red), hydrogen (white), carbon (black), and nitrogen (blue). It is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a role in energy metabolism.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, given they are both forms of niacin.",
      "answer": "Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both forms of niacin. Nicotinic acid is the acid form of niacin, commonly known as vitamin B3 or niacin, and is water-soluble. Nicotinamide is the amide form of niacin and also serves as a coenzyme in many metabolic pathways. Both are essential for human health, supporting energy metabolism and nerve function.",

      "question": "Describe how a diet primarily consisting of corn products can lead to pellagra, despite corn being a good source of niacin.",
      "answer": "Pellagra is caused by a deficiency in niacin, which is abundant in corn. However, corn contains phytic acid, which can block the absorption of niacin. Additionally, corn products are often processed, which can further reduce niacin availability. This dietary pattern, lacking in diverse sources of niacin, can lead to pellagra due to inadequate intake and reduced absorption of the vitamin.",
