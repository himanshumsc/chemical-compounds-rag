    {
      "question": "Describe the process and significance of cyanoacrylate polymerization in adhesive applications.",
      "answer": "Cyanoacrylate polymerization involves the reaction of two carboxyl groups from two molecules of cyanoacrylate, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond and the release of water. This reaction is highly exothermic and rapid, leading to strong adhesion. Cyanoacrylate adhesives are used in various applications due to their quick bonding properties and ease of use.",
