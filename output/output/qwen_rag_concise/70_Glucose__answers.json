      "question": "Discuss the solubility of glucose in various solvents and its implications for biological systems.",
      "answer": "Glucose, a carbohydrate, is highly soluble in water due to its hydrophilic nature. It dissolves readily in aqueous solutions, influencing osmosis and cell metabolism. Its solubility in non-polar solvents like ethanol or acetone is limited, affecting its role in biological systems, including cellular transport and energy metabolism. Solubility in blood plasma supports glucose's function as an energy source.",
