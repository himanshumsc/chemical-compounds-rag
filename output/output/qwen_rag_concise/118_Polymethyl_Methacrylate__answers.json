      "question": "Explain why Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) is preferred over glass for certain applications.",
      "answer": "Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) is preferred over glass for certain applications due to its transparency, ease of processing, and lower weight. PMMA is also more flexible and can be bent without breaking, unlike glass, which can shatter. Additionally, PMMA is less brittle and more resistant to impact, making it safer for some uses.",

      "question": "Describe the process of manufacturing Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) starting from its monomer.",
      "answer": "Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) is made by polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer. MMA is synthesized from methanol and carbon monoxide (CO) over a copper-zinc oxide catalyst. Polymerization occurs through radical mechanisms, resulting in a polymer with a repeating -CH2-CH(COCH3)- unit.",
