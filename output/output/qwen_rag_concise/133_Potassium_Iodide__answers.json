      "question": "Describe the process of how Potassium Iodide can be made using iodine and potassium hydroxide.",
      "answer": "To prepare Potassium Iodide from iodine and potassium hydroxide, iodine is reacted with potassium hydroxide (KOH) in an aqueous solution. The reaction occurs as follows:\nI2 + 2KOH → KI + KIO + H2O\nThe iodine (I2) reacts with the potassium hydroxide, producing potassium iodide (KI), potassium iodate (KIO), and water (H2O). This reaction is typically carried out at room temperature and is catalyzed by the presence of KOH, which is a strong base. The resulting potassium iodide is a water-soluble compound used in various applications, including as a dietary supplement and in the production of iodized salt.",

      "question": "Explain how Potassium Iodide acts as a protective agent against radiation exposure.",
      "answer": "Potassium Iodide is a protective agent against radiation exposure, particularly against radioactive iodine. When ingested, it saturates the thyroid gland, preventing it from absorbing radioactive iodine that might otherwise damage the gland and cause cancer. This makes potassium iodide a critical component in emergency kits for areas with known radiation risks.",
