      "question": "Describe the different methods used to prepare Magnesium Oxide and how they affect its chemical reactivity.",
      "answer": "Magnesium oxide is typically prepared by the direct combination of magnesium metal with oxygen gas, producing MgO through thermal decomposition. Another method involves the thermal decomposition of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) or magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2). Both methods increase its reactivity by producing a stronger base, enhancing chemical interactions in aqueous solutions.",
