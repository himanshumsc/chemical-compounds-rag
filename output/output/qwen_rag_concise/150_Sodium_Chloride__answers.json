      "question": "Explain the industrial significance of Sodium Chloride beyond its use as a food additive.",
      "answer": "Sodium chloride, commonly known as salt, is essential in various industrial processes. It is used in the production of hydrochloric acid and chlorine in the electrolysis of brine. It is also crucial in the manufacturing of sodium hypochlorite, a powerful disinfectant. Additionally, salt is used in the production of ethylene dichloride, a precursor to PVC plastics. It is also employed in the refining of crude oil and in the extraction of bitumen.",
