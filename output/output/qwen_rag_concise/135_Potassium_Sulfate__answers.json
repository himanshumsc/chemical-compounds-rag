      "answer": "Potassium sulfate can be produced from langbeinite (a potassium-rich mineral, K2SO4·3H2O) and potassium chloride (KCl) through a chemical reaction. Potassium sulfate is formed by the dehydration of langbeinite at high temperatures, or by the reaction of langbeinite with potassium chloride in solution.",
