      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Propylene. White atoms are hydrogen, black atoms are carbon, gray sticks indicate double bonds. Relatively low toxicity, used in polymer production, and as a precursor to other organic compounds.",

      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of propylene and how it relates to its molecular structure.",
      "answer": "Propylene, a member of the alkene family, has a non-polar carbon-carbon bond and a polar carbon-hydrogen bond. Its solubility in organic solvents, such as alcohols and ethers, is due to its ability to form temporary hydrogen bonds with these solvents. In water, it is slightly soluble due to its polar nature, making it partially soluble in polar solvents like acetone.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the commercial production process of propylene and explain the role of a catalyst in this process.",
      "answer": "Propylene is produced from the cracking of propylene, primarily through a process called steam cracking. In this process, hydrocarbon feedstocks are heated in the presence of steam and a catalyst. The catalyst, typically containing metals like nickel or magnesium, helps convert the hydrocarbons into propylene. The reaction occurs at high temperatures, typically around 800-850°C, to break the hydrocarbon chains and form propylene molecules. Steaming further enhances the reaction efficiency by providing hydrogen, which can inhibit the formation of by-products. The catalyst accelerates the reaction rate without undergoing any chemical change, producing propylene efficiently.",
