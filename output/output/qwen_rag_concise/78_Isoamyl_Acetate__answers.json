      "question": "Describe the process by which Isoamyl Acetate is commercially produced and how it relates to its isomers.",
      "answer": "Isoamyl acetate is produced from the reaction of amyl alcohol with acetic acid. This process involves the dehydration of amyl alcohol to form amyl acetate. The reaction is catalyzed by acids or bases, often using sulfuric acid. The isomers of amyl acetate include 2-methyl-2-pentyl acetate and 3-methyl-2-pentyl acetate, which are produced by different isomers of amyl alcohol.",
