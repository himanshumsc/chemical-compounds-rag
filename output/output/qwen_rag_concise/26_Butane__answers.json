      "question": "Explain the difference between the two isomeric forms of butane.",
      "answer": "There are two isomeric forms of butane: n-butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3) and isobutane (CH3CH(CH3)2). n-Butane is a linear chain, while isobutane has a branched structure. This difference in structure affects their physical and chemical properties, such as boiling point and reactivity.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss the solubility and state of butane, and its implications for its use as a fuel.",
      "answer": "Butane is a gas at room temperature, but can be liquefied under pressure and temperature. When liquefied, it is often used as a fuel. Its solubility in common solvents is limited due to its nonpolar nature. Its gaseous state makes it highly flammable, suitable for use in portable cooking devices and camping stoves.",
