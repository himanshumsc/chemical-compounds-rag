      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows Ammonium Nitrate. It is made from NH3 and HNO3. It forms a white crystal when heated with water. It is used in fertilizers and explosives.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process by which ammonium nitrate is commercially manufactured.",
      "answer": "Ammonium nitrate is produced by reacting ammonia with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst at high temperatures and pressures. The reaction produces nitric acid, which then reacts with ammonia to form ammonium nitrate.",

      "question": "Explain why ammonium nitrate does not occur naturally and discuss its stability and decomposition characteristics.",
      "answer": "Ammonium nitrate does not occur naturally because it is a synthetic compound produced by combining ammonia and nitric acid. It is unstable and can decompose into nitrogen gas, water, and oxygen, releasing heat and energy.",
