      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). It's a strong base, highly corrosive, and used in various industrial processes due to its strong alkaline properties.",

      "question": "Explain why sodium hydroxide is considered a deliquescent solid and its implications.",
      "answer": "Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is considered a deliquescent solid because it absorbs moisture from the air, becoming a saturated solution in water. This process results in a visible gelatinous precipitate, which is often seen as a white powder when dried. Deliquescent solids are dangerous as they can cause severe burns and corrosion.",

      "question": "Describe the process by which sodium hydroxide is commercially produced and its relation to chlorine gas.",
      "answer": "Sodium hydroxide is produced through the electrolysis of brine. During this process, sodium chloride is electrolyzed, producing chlorine gas at the anode and sodium hydroxide at the cathode.",
