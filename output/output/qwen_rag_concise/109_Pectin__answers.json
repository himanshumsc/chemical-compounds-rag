      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows pectin, a chemical compound with a molecular structure that forms a jelly-like mass when dissolved in water. It's used as a gelatinizer in confectionery and is considered safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

      "question": "What is the solubility characteristic of pectin, and how does this property relate to its primary use?",
      "answer": "Pectin is soluble in water and most organic solvents. Its solubility relates to its use as a thickening agent and gelling agent in food products.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why pectin is classified as a mixture and not a compound, and describe its chemical structure.",
      "answer": "Pectin is classified as a mixture because it consists of various polygalacturonic acid polymers with different degrees of methylation and degree of polymerization. Its chemical structure includes a backbone of galacturonic acid residues, with side chains of methyl ester groups. Pectin's variability in structure leads to its classification as a mixture rather than a compound.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss how pectin is commercially extracted and the subsequent steps involved to modify its solubility properties.",
      "answer": "Pectin is commercially extracted from fruits and vegetables using acidic conditions. This process solubilizes pectin from plant cell walls, resulting in a crude pectin solution. Further steps involve clarification to remove impurities, followed by dialysis to remove low-molecular-weight compounds. These steps modify pectin's solubility, improving its functionality in various applications.",
