      "answer": "Friedrich Wöhler, in 1828, synthesized oxalic acid from urea, challenging the principle that organic compounds cannot be synthesized from inorganic ones, thus advancing the field of organic chemistry. This breakthrough highlighted the flexibility of organic compounds and paved the way for further exploration into synthetic organic chemistry.",
