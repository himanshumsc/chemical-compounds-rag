      "question": "Explain how calcium oxide reacts with water and the implications of this reaction.",
      "answer": "Calcium oxide (CaO) reacts with water (H2O) to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), a basic substance. This reaction releases heat, making it exothermic. Calcium hydroxide is used in various applications, such as in cement production and as a treatment for acid mine drainage.",

      "question": "Describe the role of calcium oxide in metallurgy and its chemical function during the steel-making process.",
      "answer": "Calcium oxide, also known as quicklime, is used in steel-making to remove sulfur compounds and refractory materials from the molten iron. It reacts with sulfur to form calcium sulfide, which is removed as a slag. Calcium oxide also reacts with silica to form calcium silicate, which helps reduce the viscosity of the molten steel. This process is crucial for refining steel and improving its quality.",
