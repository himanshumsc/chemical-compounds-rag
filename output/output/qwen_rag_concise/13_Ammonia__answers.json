      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows ammonia (NH3). It's a polar molecule due to the difference in electronegativity between nitrogen and hydrogen. It's used in fertilizers and its production involves high temperature and pressure.",

      "question": "How does the Haber-Bosch process produce ammonia, and why is it significant?",
      "answer": "The Haber-Bosch process produces ammonia (NH3) by combining nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) under high pressure and temperature. This process, developed in 1908, is significant because it enables the synthesis of ammonia from atmospheric gases, which is crucial for fertilizers and other industrial applications.",

      "question": "Discuss the role and environmental significance of ammonia in the atmosphere and its industrial applications.",
      "answer": "Ammonia (NH3) is a key component in atmospheric chemistry, influencing nitrogen cycling and affecting air quality. Its production from industrial processes, such as the Haber-Bosch process, releases large amounts of NOx, contributing to smog and acid rain. In agriculture, excess ammonia can lead to nitrogen runoff, impacting water quality.",
