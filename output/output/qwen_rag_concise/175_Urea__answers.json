      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure in the image shows urea. It is a nitrogen-containing compound, important in metabolism and waste removal. Its key properties include: toxic to animals when excessive, used in manufacturing, and its role in the urea cycle.",

      "question": "Explain the significance of Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea in 1828.",
      "answer": "Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea in 1828 was significant because it proved that organic compounds could be synthesized from inorganic materials, challenging the then-held vitalist view that organic substances could only be produced by living organisms. This discovery supported the theory of abiogenesis and paved the way for advancements in organic chemistry.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the urea cycle and its importance in animal metabolism.",
      "answer": "The urea cycle is a metabolic pathway in animals that converts ammonia, a toxic byproduct of amino acid metabolism, into urea, which is then excreted. It is crucial for maintaining nitrogen balance and preventing ammonia toxicity. The cycle involves several enzymes and amino acids, including ornithine, citrulline, arginase, and arginase. It is essential for the survival and function of animals, particularly in mammals.",
