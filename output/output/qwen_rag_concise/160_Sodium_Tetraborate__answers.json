      "question": "Explain the historical significance and early uses of sodium tetraborate.",
      "answer": "Sodium tetraborate, also known as borax, has historical significance dating back to ancient civilizations. It was used in various applications such as glass-making, textile dyeing, and leather tanning. Early uses included cleaning, as it has excellent surface-active properties. Borax was also used in agriculture for soil conditioning due to its alkali properties.",
