      "question": "Explain why sucrose is classified as a disaccharide and how this relates to its chemical structure.",
      "answer": "Sucrose, a disaccharide, is classified as such because it is composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, covalently bonded. Its chemical structure includes a glycosidic bond, which links the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar with the hydroxyl group of another sugar molecule. This results in a molecule with a reducing group at one end and a non-reducing group at the other, allowing it to react with specific reagents, such as Benedict's or Fehling's solution, to produce a characteristic color change.",

    {
      "question": "Describe what happens to sucrose when it is heated above its decomposition point and how this process affects its physical properties.",
      "answer": "Sucrose (table sugar) decomposes above its decomposition point, typically around 180°C, into simpler compounds such as fructose and glucose. This process, known as caramelization, results in a darker color and a stronger sweetness due to the Maillard reaction, a series of chemical reactions between amino acids and reducing sugars. The physical properties of sucrose change from a white crystalline solid to a darker, more viscous liquid.",
