      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows the molecular structure of chlorophyll. Key properties include:\n- Oxygen (red atoms) and hydrogen (white atoms) are present.\n- Carbon (black atoms) and nitrogen (blue atoms) are components.\n- Magnesium (green atom) is part of the chlorin ring.\n- Chlorophyll is involved in photosynthesis in various types of algae.",

      "question": "What elements make up chlorophyll and what is its state at room temperature?",
      "answer": "Chlorophyll is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and magnesium. At room temperature, chlorophyll is a green, solid substance.",

      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of chlorophyll a and b.",
      "answer": "Chlorophyll a and b are both water-soluble chlorophylls, but their solubility properties differ due to their different hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. Chlorophyll a has a hydroxyl group, which increases its solubility in aqueous solvents, while chlorophyll b, which lacks this hydroxyl group, is more hydrophobic and thus less soluble in water. Both chlorophylls are predominantly found in the chloroplasts of plants, where they play crucial roles in photosynthesis by absorbing light energy.",

      "question": "Discuss how chlorophyll enables plants to perform photosynthesis and mention the types of chlorophyll that exist.",
      "answer": "Chlorophyll captures light energy, primarily in the blue and red spectrum, essential for photosynthesis. Two main types of chlorophyll exist: chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Chlorophyll a is primary in most plants and has a magnesium ion at its center, while chlorophyll b, lacking the magnesium, serves as a backup.",
