      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows nylon 6, with a molecular structure composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms. Its key properties include being synthetic, stretchable, stronger as stretched, and widely used in various products.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting plastics in the context of Nylon 6 and Nylon 66.",
      "answer": "Thermoplastic polymers, like Nylon 6 and Nylon 66, can be repeatedly heated and molded without permanent changes. They return to their original form when cooled. Thermosetting plastics, such as Polycarbonates, undergo a chemical reaction during molding that makes them permanently rigid and unable to be remolded.",

      "question": "Describe the commercial production process for Nylon 66 and how it differs from the production of Nylon 6.",
      "answer": "Nylon 66 is produced by polymerizing adipic acid (HOOC(CH2)4COOH) and hexamethylenediamine (H2N(CH2)6NH2). It differs from Nylon 6, which is made by polymerizing sebacic acid and hexamethylenediamine. Both processes involve condensation polymerization to form the polymer.",
