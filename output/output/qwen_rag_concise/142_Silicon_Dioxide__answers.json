      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows silicon dioxide. Red atoms are oxygen, yellow atoms are silicon. It's highly adsorbent, absorbing up to 50% of its weight in water.",

      "question": "Describe the different structural forms of Silicon Dioxide and how they differ.",
      "answer": "Silicon dioxide (SiO₂) exists in various structural forms, including quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, and moganite. Quartz is the most common stable form, with a tetragonal structure. Tridymite and cristobalite are high-temperature polymorphs with a cubic structure. Moganite is a hexagonal polymorph with a low melting point. Each form has distinct properties, such as hardness, melting point, and optical properties.",

    {
      "question": "Explain how silicon dioxide's solubility varies and under what conditions it can dissolve.",
      "answer": "Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is insoluble in most solvents, including water, alcohol, and acetone. However, it can dissolve slightly in strong acids like hydrofluoric acid at high temperatures. Silicon dioxide forms a gelatinous precipitate in aqueous solutions, particularly when aluminum hydroxide is precipitated. It is not soluble in organic solvents under normal conditions.",
