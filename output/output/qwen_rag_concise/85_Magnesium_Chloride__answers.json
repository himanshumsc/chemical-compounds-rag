      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows magnesium chloride hexahydrate. Key properties: green atoms are chlorine; turquoise atom is magnesium; forms magnesium hydroxide by reaction with NaOH; treated with HCl to recover magnesium chloride; produces pure anhydrous magnesium chloride through heating MgCl₂·NH₄Cl·6H₂O.",

      "question": "Explain the deliquescent property of Magnesium Chloride and its transformation into a hydrated form.",
      "answer": "Magnesium chloride is deliquescent, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air and forms a hydrated form, MgCl₂·6H₂O. This hydrated form is commonly known as brine.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial process used to produce magnesium metal from Magnesium Chloride.",
      "answer": "Magnesium metal is produced industrially from magnesium chloride through the electrolysis of molten magnesium chloride. This process involves passing an electric current through the molten magnesium chloride, which causes the magnesium to be reduced and deposited at the cathode, while the chloride ion is oxidized and released as chlorine gas at the anode.",
