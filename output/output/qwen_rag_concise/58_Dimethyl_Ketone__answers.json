      "question": "Explain the process by which Dimethyl Ketone is produced using the Hock process.",
      "answer": "The Hock process, also known as the condensation reaction, is used to synthesize Dimethyl Ketone from acetic acid. In this reaction, acetic acid (CH3COOH) undergoes a condensation reaction with itself, eliminating one molecule of water (H2O) to form Dimethyl Ketone (CH3OCH2COCH3). The reaction can be represented as:\nCH3COOH + CH3COOH → CH3OCH2COCH3 + H2O\nThis process involves heating acetic acid in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, typically boron trifluoride (BF3), to facilitate the elimination of water and the formation of the ketone. The reaction is exothermic and proceeds under mild conditions, typically around 100°C.",
