      "question": "Explain why Polyvinyl Chloride does not have a boiling point and describe its decomposition behavior.",
      "answer": "Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a thermoplastic polymer. It does not have a distinct boiling point because it undergoes melting and decomposition at high temperatures. PVC decomposes when exposed to temperatures above its melting point, releasing harmful gases such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and vinyl chloride. Decomposition of PVC can be triggered by various factors, including excessive heat, UV radiation, and the presence of initiators like peroxides. This decomposition can lead to the release of toxic fumes and poses significant risks in handling or disposing of PVC materials.",
