      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows sodium cyclamate, a compound used as an artificial sweetener. It is an organic salt of cyclamic acid, a carboxylic acid. Sodium cyclamate is 10 times sweeter than saccharin.",

      "question": "Why is sodium cyclamate considered an organic salt, and what are its solubility characteristics?",
      "answer": "Sodium cyclamate is an organic salt because it is formed by the reaction of an organic acid (cyclamate) with a metal ion (sodium). Its solubility characteristics are high due to its ionic nature, making it soluble in water.",

      "question": "How did the discovery of sodium cyclamate occur, and what is its primary use today?",
      "answer": "The discovery of sodium cyclamate occurred in 1947. It was first synthesized by James Niehe and later independently by William W. Johnson. Sodium cyclamate was used as a non-caloric sweetener but was later banned due to concerns about cancer and health risks. Its primary use today is as a flavor enhancer in food products.",
