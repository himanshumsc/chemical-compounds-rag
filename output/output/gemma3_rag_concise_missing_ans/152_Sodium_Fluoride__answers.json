Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question.

It\nresists the action of even strong solvents, such as hot con-\ncentrated sulfuric acid. The compound often occurs as a\nhydrate containing one or more molecules of water of hydra-\ntion. The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially. In the first method, alumina\ntrihydrate (aluminum hydroxide; Al(OH)3) is treated with\nhydrofluoric acid (HF). A second method of preparation is\nalmost identical except that it takes place in the dry state\nF\nF\nF\nAl\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n41\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.720)]\nHYDROCARBON A chemical compound consisting of only\ncarbon and hydrogen, such as fossil fuels.\nHYDROGENATION A chemical reaction of a substance with\nmolecular hydrogen, usually in the presence of a catalyst.\nHYDROLYSIS The process by which a compound reacts with\nwater to form two new compounds.\n•\nI\nINCOMPLETE COMBUSTION Combustion that occurs in such a\nway that fuel is not completely oxidized.\nINERT A substance that is chemically inactive.\nINORGANIC Relating to or obtained from nonliving things.\nION An atom or molecule with an electrical charge, either\npositive or negative.\nIONIC BOND A force that attracts and holds positive and\nnegative ions together.\nIONIC COMPOUND A compound that is composed of positive\nand negative ions, so that the total charge of the positive\nions is balanced by the total charge of the negative ions.\nISOMER Two or more forms of a chemical compound with the\nsame molecular formula, but different structural formu-\nlas and different chemical and physical properties.\nISOTOPE A form of an element with the usual number of\nprotons in the nucleus but more or less than the usual\nnumber of electrons.\n•\nK\nKREBS CYCLE A series of chemical reactions in the body that\nform part of the pathway by which cells break down\ncarbohydrates, fats, and proteins for energy.
