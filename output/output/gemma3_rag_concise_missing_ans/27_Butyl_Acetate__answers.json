          "text": "compounds, they usually use only the official IUPAC name\nfor a compound since that name leaves no doubt as to the\nsubstance about which they are talking. In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

It occurs naturally in\npetroleum, from which it is extracted at refineries. The com-\npound was first discovered in petroleum in 1886 by the\nEnglish chemist Henry E. Armstrong (1848–1937) and his\ncolleague A. K. Miller (no dates available). This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance. Even then, Lebedev’s invention, called polybuta-\ndiene, was primarily a laboratory curiosity. There was rela-\ntively little demand for rubber products that could not be\nmet by the vast supplies of natural rubber from Southeast\nAsia.\nThat situation began to change in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe demand for rubber products in automobiles and other\nmotor vehicles, especially tires, grew rapidly as car and truck\nproduction increased rapidly year after year.

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds. In a third type of struc-\ntural formula, the ball-and-stick formula, each element is\nReader’s Guide\nxiv\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.681)]\nGlycerol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 349\nHexane. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 353\nHydrogen Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 357\nHydrogen Peroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 363\nIron(II) Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 367\nIron(III) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .371\nIsoamyl Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 377\nIsoprene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .381\nIsopropyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 387\nLactic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .391\nLactose. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 397\nL-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester. . . . 401\nLuminol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 407\nMagnesium Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 411\nMagnesium Hydroxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .415\nMagnesium Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .419\nMagnesium Silicate Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . 423\nMagnesium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 429\nMenthol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 435\nMercury(II) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 439\nMethane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443\nMethyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 449\nMethyl Mercaptan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 455\nMethyl-t-butyl Ether . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 459\nMonosodium Glutamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 465\nN,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide. . . . . . . . . . 469\nNaphthalene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 473\nNaproxen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 477\nNiacin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 483\nNicotine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 487\nNitric Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 493\nNitric Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 497\nNitrogen Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 503\nNitroglycerin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 507\nviii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.681)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.676)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nBiethylene; bivinyl;\ndivinyl; erythrene;\nvinylethylene\nFORMULA:\nCH2=CHCH=CH2\nELEMENTS:\nCarbon, hydrogen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nAlkene (unsaturated\nhydrocarbon)\nSTATE:\nGas\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n54.09 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n\u0002108.91\u0003C\n(\u0002164.04\u0003F)\nBOILING POINT:\n\u00024.41\u0003C (\u000224.1\u0003F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nInsoluble in water;\nsoluble in alcohol,\nether, and benzene\n1,3-Butadiene\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\n1,3-butadiene (one-three-byoo-tah-DYE-een) is a colorless\ngas with a mild, slightly sweet odor.

Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.

It occurs naturally in\npetroleum, from which it is extracted at refineries. The com-\npound was first discovered in petroleum in 1886 by the\nEnglish chemist Henry E. Armstrong (1848–1937) and his\ncolleague A. K. Miller (no dates available). This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance. Even then, Lebedev’s invention, called polybuta-\ndiene, was primarily a laboratory curiosity. There was rela-\ntively little demand for rubber products that could not be\nmet by the vast supplies of natural rubber from Southeast\nAsia.\nThat situation began to change in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe demand for rubber products in automobiles and other\nmotor vehicles, especially tires, grew rapidly as car and truck\nproduction increased rapidly year after year.
