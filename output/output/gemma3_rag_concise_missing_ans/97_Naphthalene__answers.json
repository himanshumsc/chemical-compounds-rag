Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question.

As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide settles\nout of the reaction mixture as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipi-\ntate, which can then be dried and saved as a white powder. The\naluminum hydroxide can also be precipitated by passing\ncarbon dioxide gas through the solution.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAluminum hydroxide is an effective antacid because it is,\nchemically, a base. As such, it reacts with stomach acid\n(hydrochloric acid; HCl), to reduce the symptoms of heart-\nburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis, an\ninflammation of the stomach lining. The compound can also\nbe used to treat peptic ulcers on a long-term basis. A peptic\nulcer is an open sore in the lining of the stomach or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nAluminum hydroxide also has a number of industrial\napplications, such as:\n• A raw material for the preparation of other aluminum\ncompounds;\n• An additive for cosmetics, paper, plastics, and rubber to\ngive the final product more bulk;\nAluminum hydroxide.

It occurs\nas a colorless gas with a sweet odor when pure, but an\nunpleasant odor due to the presence of phosphine (PH3)\nand/or arsine (AsH3), with which it is often contaminated.\nAcetylene is a highly flammable gas that is also somewhat\nexplosive. This property accounts for one of its most impor-\ntant uses, in torches that burn at very high temperatures.\nAcetylene\nwas\ndiscovered\nby\nthe\nBritish\nchemist\nEdmund Davy (1785–1857) in 1836. Davy obtained the gas\naccidentally when he combined water with potassium carbide\n(KCH2) while attempting to make potassium metal. He noted\nthat the gas burned with a bright flame and thought it\nmight be used as a source of illumination. That application\nwas impractical, however, because of the high cost of potas-\nsium carbide.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.738)]\nGlycerol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 349\nHexane. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 353\nHydrogen Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 357\nHydrogen Peroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 363\nIron(II) Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 367\nIron(III) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .371\nIsoamyl Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 377\nIsoprene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .381\nIsopropyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 387\nLactic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .391\nLactose. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 397\nL-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester. . . . 401\nLuminol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 407\nMagnesium Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 411\nMagnesium Hydroxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .415\nMagnesium Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .419\nMagnesium Silicate Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . 423\nMagnesium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 429\nMenthol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 435\nMercury(II) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 439\nMethane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443\nMethyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 449\nMethyl Mercaptan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 455\nMethyl-t-butyl Ether . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 459\nMonosodium Glutamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 465\nN,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide. . . . . . . . . . 469\nNaphthalene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 473\nNaproxen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 477\nNiacin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 483\nNicotine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 487\nNitric Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 493\nNitric Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 497\nNitrogen Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 503\nNitroglycerin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 507\nviii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.737)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC",
