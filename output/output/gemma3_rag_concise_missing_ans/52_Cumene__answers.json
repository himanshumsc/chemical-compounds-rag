Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n",

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.727)]\nIn addition to its use as a vitamin supplement for normal\nindividuals and those at risk for vitamin E deficiency, the\ntocopherols have a few other uses:\n• In the curing of meat to block the action of nitrosa-\nmines, a group of compound that occurs naturally in\nmeats and may be carcinogenic;\n• As an additive to animal feed to replace vitamins lost\nduring feed processing; and\n• As a food additive in vegetable oils and shortening to\nprevent oxidation (spoilage).\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nChallem, Jack, and Melissa Diane Smith.

Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries.

The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n",

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n",
