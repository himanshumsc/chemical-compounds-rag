In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate.

This property causes it to react vigorously with metals.\n\nReactions with metals typically involve the metal being oxidized (losing electrons) while nitric acid is reduced (gaining electrons). The products vary depending on the metal and concentration of nitric acid, yielding metal nitrates, water, and nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂, N₂O).

Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question. The For Further Information\nsection may also contain this information.\nInteresting Facts This section contains facts and tidbits\nof information about compounds that may not be essential to\na chemist, an inventor, or some other scientific specialist,\nbut may be of interest to the general reader.\nCommon Uses and Potential Hazards Chemical com-\npounds are often of greatest interest because of the way they\ncan be used in medicine, industry, or some other practical\napplication. This section lists the most important uses of\neach compound described in the book.\nAll chemical compounds pose some risk to humans. One\nmight think that water, sugar, and salt are the safest com-\npounds in the world. But, of course, one can drown in water,\nbecome seriously overweight by eating too much sugar, and\ndevelop heart problems by using too much salt. The risk\nposed by a chemical compound really depends on a number\nof factors, one of the most important of which is the amount\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nxvii\nReader’s Guide\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.711)]\nOXIDIZE To combine a substance with oxygen, or to remove\nhydrogen from a molecule using oxygen, or to remove\nelectrons from a molecule.\n•\nP\nPARTICULATE MATTER Tiny particles of pollutants sus-\npended in the air.\nPETROCHEMICALS Chemical compounds that form in rocks,\nsuch as petroleum and coal.\nPH (POTENTIAL HYDROGEN) The acidity or alkalinity of a\nsubstance based on its concentration of hydrogen ions.\nPHOSPHATE A compound that is a salt of phosphoric acid,\nwhich consists of phosphorus, oxygen, sometimes hydro-\ngen, and another element or ion.\nPHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT The emission of electrons by a sub-\nstance, especially metal, when light falls on its surface.\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS The process by which green plants and\nsome other organisms using the energy in sunlight to\nconvert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and\noxygen.\nPHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT A type of photoelectric effect where\nlight is converted to electrical voltage by a substance.\nPLASTICIZER A substance added to plastics to make them\nstronger and more flexible.\nPOLYAMIDE A polymer, such as nylon, containing recurrent\namide groups linking segments of the polymer chain.\nPOLYMER A substance composed of very large molecules\nbuilt up by linking small molecules over and over again.\nPOLYSACCHARIDE A very large molecule made of many thou-\nsands of simple sugar molecules joined to each other in\nlong, complex chains.\nxlvi\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nWords to Know\n"
