          "text": "For many years the way aspirin works in the body was not\nunderstood. Scientists now know that the compound’s helpful\neffects come from its action on prostaglandins. Prostaglandins\nare hormone-like substances released by cells that are injured.\nThey cause the body to release other substances that sensitize\nnerve endings to pain and start the healing process. Aspirin\nblocks prostaglandin production, thus relieving the sensation\nof pain and the inflammation that are the body’s response to\ninjury. Aspirin reduces fever by acting on the region of the\nbrain that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Prosta-\nglandins block the body’s natural system for producing heat\nso that by blocking the release of prostaglandins, aspirin\nallows the regulation of body temperature to continue as\nusual.

Thromboxane A2 promotes\nthe accumulation of cells that takes place when a blood clot\nforms. By blocking or slowing down the production of throm-\nboxane A2, aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots and,\nhence, the probability of heart attack and stroke.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe modern method for making aspirin was developed in\n1897 by the German chemist Felix Hoffman (1868–1946), an\nemployee of the German chemical manufacturer Bayer AG\nChemical Works.

Scientists now know that the compound’s helpful\neffects come from its action on prostaglandins. Prostaglandins\nare hormone-like substances released by cells that are injured.\nThey cause the body to release other substances that sensitize\nnerve endings to pain and start the healing process. Aspirin\nblocks prostaglandin production, thus relieving the sensation\nof pain and the inflammation that are the body’s response to\ninjury. Aspirin reduces fever by acting on the region of the\nbrain that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Prosta-\nglandins block the body’s natural system for producing heat\nso that by blocking the release of prostaglandins, aspirin\nallows the regulation of body temperature to continue as\nusual. Aspirin’s protection against heart attack and stroke\noccur because of its effect on one special type of prostaglan-\ndin, known as thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 promotes\nthe accumulation of cells that takes place when a blood clot\nforms. By blocking or slowing down the production of throm-\nboxane A2, aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots and,\nhence, the probability of heart attack and stroke.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe modern method for making aspirin was developed in\n1897 by the German chemist Felix Hoffman (1868–1946), an\nemployee of the German chemical manufacturer Bayer AG\nChemical Works. In this procedure, phenol (C6H5OH) is treated\nwith sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide to make salicylic\nInteresting Facts\n• The name aspirin comes\nfrom a very old name for\nsalicylic acid, spiraeic acid.\n• After Hofmann’s discov-\nery, Bayer received a\nregistered trademark for\nthe name aspirin, meaning\nthat no other company\ncould use the name for\nacetylsalicylic acid. When\nGermany was defeated in\nWorld War I (1914–1918),\nAllied forces seized the\nBayer company’s property\nand possessions and made\nthe name available to all\ndrug manufacturers.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n33\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.525)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually. The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question. The For Further Information\nsection may also contain this information.\nInteresting Facts This section contains facts and tidbits\nof information about compounds that may not be essential to\na chemist, an inventor, or some other scientific specialist,\nbut may be of interest to the general reader.\nCommon Uses and Potential Hazards Chemical com-\npounds are often of greatest interest because of the way they\ncan be used in medicine, industry, or some other practical\napplication. This section lists the most important uses of\neach compound described in the book.\nAll chemical compounds pose some risk to humans. One\nmight think that water, sugar, and salt are the safest com-\npounds in the world. But, of course, one can drown in water,\nbecome seriously overweight by eating too much sugar, and\ndevelop heart problems by using too much salt. The risk\nposed by a chemical compound really depends on a number\nof factors, one of the most important of which is the amount\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nxvii\nReader’s Guide\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.652)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.
