Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.648)]\nacid. The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.635)]\ninflammation and swelling. Scientists believe that ibuprofen\nworks by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX),\nwhich converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Arachido-\nnic acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid that is used to\nbuild a number of important biochemical compounds, includ-\ning the prostaglandins. The prostaglandins are involved in\nthe transmission of pain impulses throughout the nervous\nsystem. If the COX enzyme is prevented from functioning,\narachidonic acid can not be converted into prostaglandins,\nand pain messages will not be transmitted.\nIbuprofen is especially effective in treating certain kinds\nof pain and inflammation, including those associated with\nmenstrual cramps, various kinds of arthritis, headaches and\nmigraines, pain from injuries and surgery, and discomfort\nassociated with influenza and gout.\nThe major risk associated with use of ibuprofen is sto-\nmach irritation. The inventors of ibuprofen had hoped to\nfind a substance that causes less stomach irritation than\naspirin. Ibuprofen does seem to cause fewer gastrointestinal\nproblems than does aspirin. Nevertheless, it can still cause\nsevere problems in some patients, especially those who take\nlarge doses. Common complaints from the use of ibuprofen\ninclude nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea.

Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active.

On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.605)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.

The\nvast majority of people get all the vitamin E they need in\ntheir daily diets. Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active. So synthetic\nvitamin E tends to be about\nhalf as active biologically as\nnatural vitamin E.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n39\nALPHA TOCOPHEROL\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.601)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.
