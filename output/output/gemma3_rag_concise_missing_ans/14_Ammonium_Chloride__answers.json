The last of these methods\nis commercially attractive because fluorosilicic acid is\nobtained inexpensively as a by-product in the production of\nfertilizers and phosphoric acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of aluminum fluoride is in the produc-\ntion of aluminum metal. In that process, aluminum is\nextracted from one of its compounds (usually aluminum\noxide) by passing an electric current through the molten\n(melted) compound. The addition of aluminum fluoride to\nthe raw materials used in the process reduces the temperature\nat which the reaction occurs and improves the conductivity of\nthe molten compound.\nSome other uses of aluminum fluoride include:\n• As a catalyst in the synthesis of organic compounds;\n• To suppress the process of fermentation in the wine-\nand beer-making industries;\nAluminum fluoride. Red atom\nis aluminum and green atoms\nare fluorine. P U B L I S H E R S\nR E S O U R C E G R O U P\n42\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nALUMINUM FLUORIDE\n"
