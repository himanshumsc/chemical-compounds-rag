Corundum is second hardest naturally occurring mineral.\nOnly diamond is harder. Aluminum oxide occurs in a variety of\nchemical forms in a variety of gemstones, including chryso-\nberyl, ruby, sapphire, and spinel. The color of these gemstones\nis a result of impurities, such as chromium (in the case of ruby)\nand iron and titanium (in the case of sapphire). The colors may\nalso vary depending on the kind and amount of each impurity.\nAluminum oxide’s commercial uses depend not only on its\nhardness, but also on its high melting point and its low elec-\ntrical conductivity. The compound is also non-combustible and\nresistant to attack by most solvents and other chemical agents.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAluminum oxide is produced by washing the rocky mate-\nrial bauxite with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nAl\nAl\nO\nO\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n49\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.738)]\n(NaOH). As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide settles\nout of the reaction mixture as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipi-\ntate, which can then be dried and saved as a white powder. The\naluminum hydroxide can also be precipitated by passing\ncarbon dioxide gas through the solution.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAluminum hydroxide is an effective antacid because it is,\nchemically, a base. As such, it reacts with stomach acid\n(hydrochloric acid; HCl), to reduce the symptoms of heart-\nburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis, an\ninflammation of the stomach lining. The compound can also\nbe used to treat peptic ulcers on a long-term basis. A peptic\nulcer is an open sore in the lining of the stomach or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nAluminum hydroxide also has a number of industrial\napplications, such as:\n• A raw material for the preparation of other aluminum\ncompounds;\n• An additive for cosmetics, paper, plastics, and rubber to\ngive the final product more bulk;\nAluminum hydroxide. Red\natoms are oxygen; white atoms\nare hydrogen; and turquoise\natom is aluminum.

It\nresists the action of even strong solvents, such as hot con-\ncentrated sulfuric acid. The compound often occurs as a\nhydrate containing one or more molecules of water of hydra-\ntion. The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially. In the first method, alumina\ntrihydrate (aluminum hydroxide; Al(OH)3) is treated with\nhydrofluoric acid (HF).
