It is one of a family of compounds, the\ntocopherols, that makes up vitamin E. Other members of the\nfamily include the beta (b), gamma (g), delta (d), and epsilon\n(E) tocopherols. All tocopherols share the same basic molecu-\nlar structure, differing only in slightly different arrange-\nments of methyl (CH3-) and hydroxyl (OH-) groups. In terms\nof biological activity, a-tocopherol is the most important\nmember of the tocopherol family. The tocopherols are all pale\nyellow, viscous oils found in a variety of plants, including\nalmonds, mustard greens, green and red peppers, spinach,\nand sunflower seeds.
