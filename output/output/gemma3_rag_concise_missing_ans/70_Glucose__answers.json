          "text": "has been used in one other very different way: in the treat-\nment of cancer. The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n",

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.689)]\nIn addition to its use as a vitamin supplement for normal\nindividuals and those at risk for vitamin E deficiency, the\ntocopherols have a few other uses:\n• In the curing of meat to block the action of nitrosa-\nmines, a group of compound that occurs naturally in\nmeats and may be carcinogenic;\n• As an additive to animal feed to replace vitamins lost\nduring feed processing; and\n• As a food additive in vegetable oils and shortening to\nprevent oxidation (spoilage).\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nChallem, Jack, and Melissa Diane Smith.

The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.616)]\nPRECIPITATE A solid material that settles out of a solution,\noften as the result of a chemical reaction.\nPRECURSOR A compound that gives rise to some other com-\npound in a series of reactions.\nPROPRIETARY Manufactured, sold, or known only by the\nowner of the item’s patent.\nPROSTAGLANDINS A group of potent hormone-like sub-\nstances that are produced in various tissues of the\nbody. Prostaglandins help with a wide range of physiolo-\ngical functions, such as control of blood pressure,\ncontraction of smooth muscles, and modulation of inflam-\nmation.\nPROTEIN A large, complex compound made of long chains of\namino acids. Proteins have a number of essential func-\ntions in living organisms.\n•\nQ\nQUARRY An open pit, often big, that is used to obtain stone.\n•\nR\nREAGENT A substance that is employed to react, measure, or\ndetect with another substance.\nREDUCTION A chemical reaction in which oxygen is removed\nfrom a substance or electrons are added to a substance.\nREFRACTORY A material with a high melting point, resistant\nto melting, often used to line the interior of industrial\nfurnaces.\nRESIN A solid or semi-solid organic material that is used to\nmake lacquers, adhesives, plastics, and many other clear\nsubstances.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nxlvii\nWords to Know\n",
