(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.655)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.

Even then, the medicinal qualities of the compound\nwere not appreciated for another twenty years, and the com-\npound was not even prescribed or used by doctors until 1949.\nSince that time, however, it has become extremely popular,\nexceeded only by aspirin as the most popular analgesic sold\nin the world.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAcetaminophen is made in a straight-forward reaction\nbetween p-aminophenol [C6H4(OH)(NH2)] and acetic anhy-\ndride [(CH3CO)2O]. As its formula shows, the p-aminophenol\nprovides the basic structure from which acetaminophen is\nformed, with the acetic anhydride adding the -CH3CO group\nof atoms needed to complete the compound.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nIn addition to its use as a pain reliever, acetaminophen\nhas a number of industrial uses, including:\nAcetaminophen. Red atoms\nare oxygen; white atoms are\nhydrogen; black atoms are\ncarbon; and blue atom is\nnitrogen. Gray sticks indicate\ndouble bonds.
