In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n",

Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations.

In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.601)]\nhas been used in one other very different way: in the treat-\nment of cancer. The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.599)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n"
