Even then, the medicinal qualities of the compound\nwere not appreciated for another twenty years, and the com-\npound was not even prescribed or used by doctors until 1949.\nSince that time, however, it has become extremely popular,\nexceeded only by aspirin as the most popular analgesic sold\nin the world.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAcetaminophen is made in a straight-forward reaction\nbetween p-aminophenol [C6H4(OH)(NH2)] and acetic anhy-\ndride [(CH3CO)2O]. As its formula shows, the p-aminophenol\nprovides the basic structure from which acetaminophen is\nformed, with the acetic anhydride adding the -CH3CO group\nof atoms needed to complete the compound.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nIn addition to its use as a pain reliever, acetaminophen\nhas a number of industrial uses, including:\nAcetaminophen. Red atoms\nare oxygen; white atoms are\nhydrogen; black atoms are\ncarbon; and blue atom is\nnitrogen. Gray sticks indicate\ndouble bonds.
