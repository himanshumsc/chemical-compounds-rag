      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of isopropyl alcohol?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for isopropyl alcohol, also known as 2-propanol, is \\( \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7\\text{OH} \\).\n\nTo find the molecular weight, we calculate the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule:\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01 g/mol.\n- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1.01 g/mol.\n- Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16.00 g/mol.\n\nNow, we calculate the total atomic weight for each element in the molecule:\n- Carbon: \\( 3 \\times 12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 36.03 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n- Hydrogen: \\( 7 \\times 1.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 7.07 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n- Oxygen: \\( 1 \\times 16.00 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 16.00 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n\nAdding these together gives the molecular weight:\n\\[ 36.03 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 7.07 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 16.00 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 59.10 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nSo, the molecular weight of isopropyl alcohol (2-propanol) is \\( 59.10 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\).",

      "question": "Explain why isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as a rubbing alcohol in medical settings.",
      "answer": "Isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol, is a commonly used substance in medical settings for several reasons:\n\n1. Antiseptic Properties: Isopropyl alcohol acts as an antiseptic by disrupting the cell membrane of microorganisms, thus killing bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This makes it effective in preventing the spread of infection on the skin or other surfaces.\n\n2. Quick and Convenient: Rubbing alcohol is easy to use and apply, making it ideal for quick disinfection of skin in medical settings. It is also quick-drying, leaving the skin feeling dry and comfortable.\n\n3. Safe for Most Skin Types: Isopropyl alcohol is generally considered safe for most skin types, making it a versatile choice for various medical applications such as sterilizing medical instruments, wound care, and cleaning surfaces.\n\n4. Non-Irritating: Unlike other disinfectants, isopropyl alcohol is non-irritating and does not cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in most people. This makes it a suitable option for use on sensitive skin or in areas where irritation can be a concern.\n\n5. Suitable for Antibacterial Wipes: Isopropyl alcohol is often used in conjunction with other disinfectants in antibacterial wipes, which are frequently used in medical settings to disinfect surfaces and prevent the spread of infections.\n\n6. Low Cost: Isopropyl alcohol is relatively inexpensive compared to other disinfectants, making it a cost-effective choice for medical settings.\n\nIn conclusion, isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as rubbing alcohol in medical settings due to its antiseptic properties, quick and convenient use, safe nature, non-irritating properties, and suitability for use with other disinfectants. Additionally, it is a cost-effective option for medical settings.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial process used to produce isopropyl alcohol and identify the catalyst involved.",
      "answer": "The industrial process used to produce isopropyl alcohol, also known as 2-propanol, typically involves the hydration of propylene, a process that involves the addition of a water molecule to the carbon backbone of the propylene molecule. This is a step in the production of ethylene glycol, which is itself a building block for other chemicals, including the ethylene glycol that is used as an antifreeze in cars. However, the direct production of isopropyl alcohol from propylene involves a more complex series of reactions.\n\n### Steps in the Production of Isopropyl Alcohol:\n\n1. **Propylene Conversion to Propylene Oxide:**\n   - The first step is to convert propylene to propylene oxide. This process is typically conducted over a catalyst, usually a highly acidic zeolite, such as zeolite HZSM-5, which is a form of zeolite with a unique pore size and acidity that is suitable for this reaction.\n   - The propylene oxide is produced by passing propylene through a bed of zeolite HZSM-5 at high temperatures (often around 200-300°C) and high pressures (around 20-50 atmospheres).\n\n2. **Hydration of Propylene Oxide:**\n   - The propylene oxide is then hydrated to form isopropyl alcohol. This reaction is typically conducted at a lower temperature and pressure compared to the production of propylene oxide, around 100-150°C and 10-20 atmospheres.\n   - The catalyst for this reaction is usually a solid acid, such as sulfuric acid, which acts as an acid catalyst to facilitate the hydration of the propylene oxide to isopropyl alcohol.\n\n### Summary:\nThe industrial process to produce isopropyl alcohol involves two main steps:\n1. **Propylene Oxide Production:**\n   - This step uses a zeolite catalyst, specifically zeolite HZSM-5, to convert propylene to propylene oxide.\n2. **Propylene Oxide Hydration to Isopropyl Alcohol:**\n   - This step uses a solid acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, to convert propylene oxide to isopropyl alcohol.\n\nIt's important to note that while sulfuric acid is a catalyst for the hydration of propylene oxide, it is not one of the main catalysts used in",
