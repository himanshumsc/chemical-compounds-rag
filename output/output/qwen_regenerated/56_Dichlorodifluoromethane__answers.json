      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows dichlorodifluoromethane, commonly known as Freon-12, a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Its key properties include:\n\n1. **Chemical Composition**: \n   - It consists of one carbon (C) atom, two chlorine (Cl) atoms, and two fluorine (F) atoms.\n   - The color coding in the diagram indicates:\n     - Black (carbon, C),\n     - Turquoise (fluorine, F),\n     - Green (chlorine, Cl).\n\n2. **Double Bond**: \n   - The gray stick shows a double bond between the carbon and chlorine atoms.\n\n3. **Toxicity and Flammability**: \n   - Freon-12 is non-toxic and non-flammable, making it a safer alternative to ammonia and sulfur dioxide, which were common refrigerants but posed significant risks.\n\n4. **Efficiency and Safety**: \n   - It enables cooling systems to operate more efficiently and more safely than previous refrigerants like ammonia and sulfur dioxide.\n   - Due to its stability and inertness, it was widely used in refrigeration systems and other industrial applications.\n\n5. **Environmental Impact**:\n   - In the 1970s, scientists discovered that CFCs, including Freon-12, were contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer in the Earth's stratosphere. This led to the Montreal Protocol and the subsequent phase-out of CFCs.\n\nThese properties make dichlorodifluoromethane a crucial compound in the history of refrigeration and industrial processes, but its later environmental impact necessitated its replacement with safer alternatives.",

      "question": "How does dichlorodifluoromethane's solubility vary between water and other solvents like alcohol and ether?",
      "answer": "Dichlorodifluoromethane, also known as Freon-12 (CCl₂F₂), is a volatile liquid that is widely used as a refrigerant in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. However, its solubility in water and other common solvents like alcohol (ethanol, C₂H₅OH) and ether (diethyl ether, C₄H₁₀O) is quite limited due to its chemical structure and polarity.\n\n### Solubility in Water:\n- **Solubility:** Dichlorodifluoromethane has very low solubility in water. According to the Henry's Law of solubility, the solubility of a gas in a solvent is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the solution. For gases like dichlorodifluoromethane, which are not very soluble in water due to their strong London dispersion forces and polarizability, the solubility in water can be measured in parts per million (ppm) at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure.\n\n- **Measurement:** The exact solubility in water can vary depending on the experimental conditions, but typically, dichlorodifluoromethane is considered to be practically insoluble in water at room temperature.\n\n### Solubility in Alcohol:\n- **Solubility:** Dichlorodifluoromethane has even lower solubility in alcohol compared to water. Alcohols are polar solvents and can dissolve many polar or ionic materials, but dichlorodifluoromethane's high London dispersion forces and non-polarity make it practically insoluble in alcohol. The solubility in alcohol is still in the ppm range.\n\n### Solubility in Ether:\n- **Solubility:** Dichlorodifluoromethane has very low solubility in ether. Ether is a non-polar solvent and while it can dissolve some non-polar compounds, dichlorodifluoromethane's strong London dispersion forces and polarizability make it practically insoluble in ether as well. The solubility in ether is also in the ppm range.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, dichlorodifluoromethane has extremely low solubility in all of these solvents. Its solubility is best measured in parts per million (ppm), and it is practically insoluble in water, alcohol, and",

      "question": "Explain why dichlorodifluoromethane is categorized as both a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and an alkyl halide.",
      "answer": "Dichlorodifluoromethane (also known as Freon-12 or CFC-12) is categorized as both a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and an alkyl halide for the following reasons:\n\n### Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC):\n- **Structural Characteristics**: CFCs are organic compounds that contain both chlorine and fluorine atoms. They are derived from a substituted alkane or alkene where hydrogen atoms are replaced by chlorine and/or fluorine.\n- **Chemical Composition**: Dichlorodifluoromethane has the chemical formula CCl₂F₂, which means it consists of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine atoms. It fits the general structure of CFCs, which is C(F,Cl)nH12n, where n is a positive integer.\n- **Environmental Impact**: CFCs have been historically used in refrigerants, aerosol propellants, and other applications. Due to their persistence in the environment, CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, making them a harmful pollutant.\n\n### Alkyl Halide:\n- **Definition**: An alkyl halide is an organic compound that has an alkyl group (which can be an alkane, alkene, or alkyne) attached to a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine).\n- **Chemical Composition**: In dichlorodifluoromethane, the alkyl group is a methyl group (CH₃), and the halogen atoms are chlorine and fluorine. This fits the definition of an alkyl halide, specifically a methyl halide where the halogen atoms are chlorine and fluorine.\n- **Chemical Reactivity**: Alkyl halides are reactive compounds due to the partial positive charge on the carbon atom in the alkyl group, which is attached to the halogen atom. This can lead to substitution reactions under certain conditions.\n\n### Summary:\n- **CFC**: Dichlorodifluoromethane is a CFC because it contains both chlorine and fluorine atoms. It is used historically in refrigerants and other applications and contributes to the ozone depletion.\n- **Alkyl Halide**: It is also an alkyl halide because it has a methyl group (CH₃) attached to two halogen atoms (one chlorine and one fluorine).
