      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows nitric acid (HNO₃). According to the text accompanying the image, nitric acid is composed of one hydrogen atom (H), one nitrogen atom (N), and three oxygen atoms (O). It has a molecular weight of approximately 63.01 g/mol and is a strong mineral acid. Key properties of nitric acid include:\n\n1. **Acidity**: It is a strong acid, capable of ionizing completely in water to form H⁺ (hydrogen ions) and NO₃⁻ (nitrate ions).\n2. **Oxidizing Properties**: Nitric acid acts as a strong oxidizing agent due to the high oxidation state of nitrogen (VII) in the NO₃⁻ ion.\n3. **Color**: It is a colorless liquid at room temperature.\n4. **Solubility**: It is highly soluble in water.\n5. **Reactivity**: It reacts vigorously with many metals and non-metals, forming salts and gases.\n\nThe Ostwald process, mentioned in the text, is a common industrial method for producing nitric acid, which involves the oxidation of ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to form nitric acid.",

      "question": "What are the primary elements that make up nitric acid, and what is its chemical formula?",
      "answer": "The primary elements that make up nitric acid are nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O). Nitric acid is primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in a specific ratio. Its chemical formula is HNO₃, which indicates that each molecule of nitric acid consists of one hydrogen atom (H), one nitrogen atom (N), and three oxygen atoms (O).",

      "question": "Discuss the physical state and solubility characteristics of nitric acid.",
      "answer": "Nitric acid, or nitric acid, is a strong mineral acid with the chemical formula HNO₃. It is a colorless liquid at room temperature, but it can appear yellowish if exposed to air for a long time due to the formation of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) from the decomposition of nitric acid. The liquid is highly corrosive and irritant, and it is hazardous to health and environment.\n\n### Physical State:\n- **Solid form**: Pure nitric acid cannot exist as a solid at room temperature. It always exists as a liquid or gas.\n- **Liquid**: At room temperature, nitric acid is a clear, colorless, and highly viscous liquid.\n- **Gas**: When heated or exposed to air, nitric acid can vaporize and turn into a gas.\n\n### Solubility Characteristics:\n- **Water Solubility**: Nitric acid is extremely soluble in water. It reacts with water to form water and nitric acid, which leads to a significant increase in temperature due to the exothermic nature of the reaction. This makes nitric acid a strong acid.\n- **Soluble in other organic solvents**: Like many other acids, nitric acid is soluble in organic solvents such as alcohols and ethers.\n- **Insoluble with strong bases**: Nitric acid does not react with strong bases like sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, as it is a strong acid.\n- **Miscibility with other substances**: Nitric acid is miscible with most other liquids, including other acids, which allows for the formation of solutions with various concentrations.\n\n### Safety Considerations:\nNitric acid is highly corrosive and can cause serious burns to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Handling this substance requires extreme caution and proper safety measures, such as wearing protective clothing, gloves, and goggles, and working in a well-ventilated area.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNitric acid is a strong mineral acid with a clear, colorless, and highly corrosive liquid state at room temperature. It dissolves easily in water and shows good solubility in certain organic solvents. Its solubility characteristics and corrosive nature make it a hazardous substance that must be handled with extreme care.",

      "question": "Explain why nitric acid is considered a strong oxidizing agent and describe its reaction with metals.",
      "answer": "Nitric acid (HNO₃) is considered a strong oxidizing agent primarily due to the high electronegativity of nitrogen, which allows the molecule to readily gain electrons. This property makes nitric acid highly reactive and capable of oxidizing other substances.\n\n### Oxidizing Properties of Nitric Acid\n1. **Electronegativity and Electron Density**: Nitric acid has a central nitrogen atom that is highly electronegative, meaning it can attract electrons from other atoms or molecules. This high electron density near nitrogen makes it a strong oxidizing agent, capable of accepting electrons from other molecules.\n2. **Oxidation State**: Nitrogen in nitric acid is in the oxidation state of +5, and it can easily drop to lower oxidation states, such as +4 in nitrous acid (HNO₂) or +3 in nitric oxide (NO), or even +2 in nitric oxide (NO²⁻), which are more reactive forms.\n3. **Redox Reactions**: In redox reactions, nitric acid can gain electrons and simultaneously oxidize other substances. This property makes nitric acid highly effective in various chemical reactions, especially in the presence of oxygen.\n\n### Reaction with Metals\nWhen metals react with nitric acid, the reaction can be quite complex and depends on the metal and its oxidation state. Here are some general cases:\n\n1. **Formation of Nitrogen Oxides**:\n   - When a metal is more reactive than iron, such as sodium or potassium, the reaction may produce nitrogen oxides (NO or NO₂) along with metallic nitrate salts.\n   - The reaction is often characterized by the formation of NO₂, which is a brown gas.\n   - Example:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{K} + 6 \\text{HNO}_3 \\rightarrow 4 \\text{KNO}_3 + 2 \\text{HNO}_2 + 3 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Formation of Nitric Oxides and Nitrogen**:\n   - For metals less reactive than iron, such as copper, zinc, and aluminum, the reaction produces a mixture of NO and NO₂ gases.\n   - Example:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Zn} + 2\\text{HNO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{Zn(NO}_3\\text{)}_2 + \\text{NO",
