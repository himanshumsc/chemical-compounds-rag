      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molar mass of methyl cyanoacrylate?",
      "answer": "Methyl cyanoacrylate (often abbreviated as MC and also known as super glue) has the chemical formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_9\\text{C}_2\\text{N}\\text{O} \\]\n\nTo calculate the molar mass, we need to sum the atomic masses of each atom in the formula. Here are the atomic masses of the elements involved:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nMethyl cyanoacrylate has one carbon atom, nine hydrogen atoms, two carbon atoms from the methyl group, one nitrogen atom, and one oxygen atom. Therefore, the molar mass is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molar mass} = (6 \\times 12.01) + (9 \\times 1.008) + (2 \\times 12.01) + (1 \\times 14.01) + (1 \\times 16.00)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Molar mass} = (6 \\times 12.01) + (9 \\times 1.008) + (2 \\times 12.01) + (1 \\times 14.01) + (1 \\times 16.00)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Molar mass} = 72.06 + 9.072 + 24.02 + 14.01 + 16.00\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Molar mass} = 135.162 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nSo, the molar mass of methyl cyanoacrylate is approximately 135.16 g/mol.",

      "question": "Explain the solubility and reactivity of cyanoacrylate with water.",
      "answer": "Cyanoacrylate, often known as superglue, is a type of cyanoacrylate ester. These esters are highly reactive and are used in adhesives due to their rapid polymerization upon contact with moisture. Let's break down the solubility and reactivity of cyanoacrylate with water.\n\n### Solubility of Cyanoacrylate with Water\n\n1. **Solubility in Water**:\n   - Cyanoacrylate esters are poorly soluble in water. They are hydrophobic and prefer to interact with each other rather than with water. This is why they can be used as adhesives; they tend to form strong bonds in the presence of moisture, rather than dissolving in water.\n\n2. **Effect of Water**:\n   - When cyanoacrylate is exposed to water, it reacts with moisture. The moisture acts as a nucleophile, and the ester undergoes a nucleophilic substitution reaction. This reaction is responsible for the rapid polymerization of cyanoacrylate, leading to the formation of a gel and eventually a solid adhesive.\n\n### Reactivity of Cyanoacrylate with Water\n\n1. **Rapid Polymerization**:\n   - Upon contact with moisture, cyanoacrylate undergoes a rapid and exothermic polymerization. The polymerization is a chain reaction where each molecule of cyanoacrylate adds a pendant group to the growing polymer chain.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{RCN} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{RCO}\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN}\n   \\]\n\n   - This reaction releases heat and forms a strong gel-like substance. The exact nature of the polymer formed can vary slightly depending on the specific cyanoacrylate ester and the conditions under which the reaction occurs.\n\n2. **Temperature Dependence**:\n   - The rate of polymerization is highly temperature-dependent. Higher temperatures enhance the rate of reaction, leading to a faster formation of the adhesive. Lower temperatures slow down the reaction, resulting in a gel forming more slowly.\n\n3. **Hydrolysis**:\n   - Cyanoacrylate esters are also susceptible to hydrolysis. Over time, especially in humid environments, the ester can break down to form a more stable bond, although this process is much slower",

      "question": "Describe the process and significance of cyanoacrylate polymerization in adhesive applications.",
      "answer": "Cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesives, also known as瞬间胶 (瞬间胶) or superglue, are commonly used in a wide range of applications due to their fast setting times and high bonding strength. They are composed of an alkyl cyanoacrylate ester, which polymerizes rapidly when exposed to moisture in the air. This polymerization process is crucial for the adhesive's performance and efficiency in various applications.\n\n**Process of Cyanoacrylate Polymerization:**\n1. **Initial Interaction:** Upon contact with moisture, the ester in the CA molecule hydrolyzes. This process involves the ester's alcohol group breaking away from the ester's carbon group.\n2. **Free Radical Formation:** The alcohol group forms a free radical, which is capable of initiating the polymerization process.\n3. **Chain Polymerization:** The free radical then reacts with another molecule of cyanoacrylate, forming a new bond and initiating a chain reaction. This polymerization continues, building long polymer chains until they are no longer able to react with the free radicals or with each other.\n4. **Formation of the Polymer Network:** The result of this chain reaction is a three-dimensional network of polymer chains, which is what gives CA adhesives their strength and ability to bond surfaces.\n\n**Significance of Cyanoacrylate Polymerization in Adhesive Applications:**\n1. **Fast Setting Time:** The polymerization process is quick, often taking just a few seconds to fully set, making CA adhesives ideal for applications where fast bonding is required. This characteristic also means that CA adhesives can dry out quickly in a humid environment, limiting their usability until they are rehydrated.\n2. **High Strength Bonding:** The strong, interlocking network of polymer chains provides considerable adhesion strength, making CA adhesives particularly useful for bonding dissimilar materials such as metals, plastics, and even certain composite materials.\n3. **Convenience and Efficiency:** Because of its speed and strength, CA adhesive is convenient for use in various hands-on tasks. It is widely used in DIY projects, crafting, and in industrial settings for temporary bonding of components before permanent bonding is done with adhesives that cure at room temperature or in an oven.\n4. **Specialized Uses:** Special formulations of CA adhesives can be designed for specific applications. For example, room temperature-curing CA adhesives provide longer working times and improved safety",
