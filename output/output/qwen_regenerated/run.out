/home/himanshu/dev/code/.venv_phi4_req/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/awq/__init__.py:21: DeprecationWarning: 
I have left this message as the final dev message to help you transition.

Important Notice:
- AutoAWQ is officially deprecated and will no longer be maintained.
- The last tested configuration used Torch 2.6.0 and Transformers 4.51.3.
- If future versions of Transformers break AutoAWQ compatibility, please report the issue to the Transformers project.

Alternative:
- AutoAWQ has been adopted by the vLLM Project: https://github.com/vllm-project/llm-compressor

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
