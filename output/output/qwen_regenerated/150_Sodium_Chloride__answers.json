      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Sodium Chloride?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Sodium Chloride is NaCl. \n\nTo find the molecular weight, we need to add up the atomic weights of the constituent elements:\n\n- The atomic weight of Sodium (Na) is approximately 22.99 amu.\n- The atomic weight of Chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.45 amu.\n\nSo, the molecular weight of NaCl is:\n\n22.99 amu (Na) + 35.45 amu (Cl) = 58.44 amu.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is approximately 58.44 amu.",

      "question": "Explain the industrial significance of Sodium Chloride beyond its use as a food additive.",
      "answer": "Sodium chloride, or table salt, has a myriad of industrial applications beyond its use as a food additive. Its significance lies in its ability to facilitate various chemical reactions and processes, as well as its role in manufacturing. Here are some key industrial applications:\n\n1. **Salt Lick for Animals**: Although not a traditional industrial use, it's important to note that salt licks are a staple in animal husbandry. Cows, sheep, and other livestock consume salt licks to replenish the sodium their bodies need. This helps maintain their health and productivity.\n\n2. **Electrolyte Replacement**: Sodium chloride is a key component in the production of drinking water and electrolyte solutions used in medical settings. It's crucial for rehydrating patients and maintaining proper electrolyte balance in the body.\n\n3. **Production of Chlorine and Soda Ash**: Sodium chloride is a primary raw material in the production of chlorine and soda ash (sodium carbonate), which are both essential in the manufacture of several chemicals and products. Sodium chloride is converted into chloride gas in an electrolytic cell, which then reacts with water to form hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.\n\n4. **De-icing Agent**: Sodium chloride is widely used as a de-icing agent in the automotive and transportation industries. It prevents ice formation on roads and highways by melting the snow and ice that accumulates on them.\n\n5. **Production of Paper**: Sodium chloride is used in the pulp and paper industry as a bleaching agent and to help in the sizing of paper. This helps in improving the paper's water resistance and overall quality.\n\n6. **Textile Dyeing**: Sodium chloride plays a significant role in the textile dyeing process. It is used to help fabric absorb dyes more effectively, ensuring better color retention and quality in the final product.\n\n7. **Manufacturing of Plastics**: Sodium chloride is used in the production of plastics like PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) as a stabilizer. It also helps in the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers.\n\n8. **Production of Ethylene Dichloride**: Sodium chloride is used in the production of ethylene dichloride, which is a precursor in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a versatile plastic used in various applications.\n\n9. **Water Treatment**: Sodium chloride is used in water treatment plants to soften water by removing calcium and magnesium ions. This process helps in preventing scaling and corrosion in industrial equipment.",
