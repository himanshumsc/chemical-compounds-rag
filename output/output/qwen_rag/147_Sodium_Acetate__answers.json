      "question": "What is the chemical formula of sodium acetate and its molecular weight?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula of sodium acetate is \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^{-} \\text{Na}^{+} \\). This formula indicates that sodium acetate is an ionic compound where the acetate anion (\\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^{-} \\)) is derived from acetic acid (\\( CH_3COOH \\)) and the sodium cation (\\( \\text{Na}^{+} \\)).\n\nThe molecular weight of sodium acetate (\\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^{-} \\text{Na}^{+} \\)) can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of the constituent elements:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n- Sodium (Na): 22.99 g/mol\n\nHowever, sodium acetate is actually a salt, which implies that the formula is \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^{-} \\text{Na}^{+} \\). The molecular weight of \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^{-} \\text{Na}^{+} \\) is calculated as follows:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol \\(\\times 2\\) = 24.02 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol \\(\\times 4\\) = 4.032 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol \\(\\times 2\\) = 32.00 g/mol\n- Sodium (Na): 22.99 g/mol\n\nThus, the molecular weight of sodium acetate is:\n\\[ 24.02 + 4.032 + 32.00 + 22.99 = 83.042 \\text{ g/mol} \\]\n\nIn summary, the chemical formula of sodium acetate is \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^{-} \\text{Na}^{+} \\), and its molecular weight is approximately 83.042 g/mol.",

      "question": "Explain the process of how sodium acetate is prepared using sodium hydroxide and acetic acid.",
      "answer": "To prepare sodium acetate using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and acetic acid (CH₃COOH), we need to consider the chemical reaction that occurs when these two substances are combined. Sodium acetate (CH₃COONa) is the salt formed when acetic acid donates a proton to the hydroxide ion in the presence of water.\n\nThe reaction can be described as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{NaOH} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COONa} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nThis is a typical acid-base reaction where the sodium hydroxide (a strong base) reacts with the acetic acid (a weak acid) to form sodium acetate (a salt) and water (a neutral product). The net ionic equation for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nIn this reaction, the hydroxide ion (OH⁻) donates a proton (H⁺) to the acetic acid, converting it into the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which forms sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which is then dissolved in water.\n\n### Properties and Uses\n- **Sodium Acetate**: Sodium acetate is a white, crystalline solid with a pleasant, fruity odor. It is highly soluble in water and is used in various applications, including:\n  - Industrial use as a raw material in the production of other compounds, such as esters and amides.\n  - In the food industry, it is used as a flavoring agent and preservative.\n  - It is also used in the preparation of other chemicals, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin).\n\n### Safety Information\nSodium acetate is generally considered safe for most uses, but like any chemical compound, it should be handled with caution. Sodium hydroxide is a strong base and can cause burns on contact with the skin or eyes, and acetic acid is corrosive. Therefore, when preparing sodium acetate, it's essential to:\n- Wear appropriate protective gear (goggles, gloves, lab coat).\n- Work in",

      "question": "Discuss why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and describe its physical properties that make it suitable for this application.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is an important compound in the textile industry due to its chemical properties and applications. Sodium acetate, or sodium ethanoate, is the sodium salt of acetic acid and has the chemical formula NaOOCCH3. Its use in the textile industry is primarily for its properties that enhance the printing quality and durability of fabrics.\n\n### Uses in the Textile Industry\n\n1. **Printing Quality**: Sodium acetate is used as a fixing agent in the dyeing process. When a fabric is dyed, the dyed areas are washed with a solution containing sodium acetate at a specific temperature and pH. This process helps set the dye permanently onto the fabric, ensuring longer-lasting colors and better print quality. Sodium acetate acts as a mild base, which neutralizes the acidity present in the dye bath, thus stabilizing the dye molecule and preventing it from leaching out.\n\n2. **Fabric Durability**: Sodium acetate is also used in the finishing process to enhance the durability of fabrics. By treating the fabric with sodium acetate, the fibers become more resistant to wear and tear, which is particularly useful for fabrics that need to withstand frequent use, such as those used in uniforms, industrial clothing, and certain types of upholstery.\n\n### Physical Properties of Sodium Acetate\n\n- **Formula**: NaOOCCH3\n- **Solubility**: Sodium acetate is readily soluble in water and other organic solvents. It dissolves in water to form an aqueous solution that can be used in dyeing processes.\n- **Appearance**: Sodium acetate is usually a white or off-white crystalline powder at room temperature.\n- **Boiling Point**: The boiling point of sodium acetate is relatively high, which is beneficial for various industrial processes. It can be processed under elevated temperatures without decomposing.\n- **Melting Point**: Sodium acetate typically melts at a temperature around 322°F (162°C), indicating it remains solid under typical textile production conditions.\n\n### Safety and Handling\n\n- **Storage**: Sodium acetate should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. It should be kept sealed in containers to prevent moisture absorption.\n- **Handling**: Handling sodium acetate requires wearing appropriate protective gear, such as gloves and goggles, to prevent exposure to skin and eyes. If sodium acetate is ingested or if there is accidental contact with it, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately.\n- **",
