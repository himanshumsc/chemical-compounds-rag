      "question": "Describe the process by which toluene is extracted from petroleum.",
      "answer": "The extraction of toluene from petroleum involves several steps, primarily focusing on distillation and separation techniques. Here's an overview of the process:\n\n### 1. **Petroleum Fractionation:**\n   - **Distillation:** Petroleum fractions are obtained through fractional distillation. This process separates the various hydrocarbons based on their boiling points.\n   - **Cutting Points:** The fraction containing toluene (C7) is isolated. This typically occurs in the range of 80-82°C.\n\n### 2. **Isolation of Toluene:**\n   - **Refluxing:** The fraction containing to",
