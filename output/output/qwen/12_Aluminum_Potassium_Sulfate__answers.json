      "question": "Discuss the historical and modern uses of aluminum potassium sulfate and the reasons for its effectiveness in these applications.",
      "answer": "Aluminum Potassium Sulfate, also known as Alum, is a compound with the chemical formula KAl(SO4)2·12H2O. It has been used since ancient times and continues to be utilized in various applications due to its unique properties.\n\nHistorically, alum has been used for dyeing fabrics and leather tanning. The process of dyeing textiles involves immersing the fabric into a solution containing alum. The alum acts as a mordant, which means it helps the dye to adhere to the fabric more effectively. This process was widely used in the textile industry before the advent of synthetic d",
