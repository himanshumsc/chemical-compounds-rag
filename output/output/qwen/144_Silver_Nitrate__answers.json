      "question": "Describe the solubility characteristics of Silver Nitrate and its behavior in the presence of light.",
      "answer": "Silver nitrate (AgNO₃) is a highly soluble compound in water, which means it dissolves readily to form a clear solution. This solubility is due to the strong ionic bonds between silver ions (Ag⁺) and nitrate ions (NO₃⁻). In aqueous solutions, Ag⁺ ions are highly mobile and can interact with other ions or molecules in the solution.\n\n### Solubility Characteristics:\n1. **Solubility in Water**: Silver nitrate is highly soluble in water. At room temperature, approximately 250 grams of AgNO₃ can dissolve in 100 grams",

      "question": "How has Silver Nitrate been historically used in medicine, and what are some of its current applications?",
      "answer": "Silver nitrate has a long history of use in medicine, primarily due to the antimicrobial properties of silver ions. Here's an overview of its historical uses and current applications:\n\n### Historical Uses:\n1. **Antiseptic**: Silver nitrate was widely used as an antiseptic for wounds and ulcers. It was applied directly to the skin or inserted into wounds to prevent infection.\n2. **Treatment of Eye Diseases**: Due to its ability to kill bacteria, silver nitrate was also used to treat eye infections and other eye diseases.\n3. **Dental Applications**: Historically, silver nitrate was used in dental procedures,",
