      "question": "Explain why the boiling point of Acetylsalicylic Acid is not applicable.",
      "answer": "The boiling point of acetylsalicylic acid (also known as aspirin) is not directly applicable in the same way it would be for other substances because aspirin is a solid at room temperature and under normal atmospheric pressure. Its melting point, which is the temperature at which it transitions from a solid to a liquid, is 138°C (280°F). This means that aspirin does not boil in the traditional sense; instead, it melts into a liquid.\n\nBoiling refers to the process where a substance changes from a liquid to a gas at its boiling point, which occurs when the vapor pressure of the",

      "question": "Discuss the historical significance of Acetylsalicylic Acid and its origins.",
      "answer": "Acetylsalicylic acid, more commonly known as aspirin, is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. Its historical significance lies in its discovery and development, which have had profound impacts on medicine and public health.\n\n### Discovery and Early Development\n\nThe story of aspirin begins with the bark of the willow tree (Salix alba). Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Greeks, used willow bark to treat fever and pain. The active ingredient in willow bark was later identified as salicin, which is converted into salicylic acid in the body.\n\nIn 1829, French",
