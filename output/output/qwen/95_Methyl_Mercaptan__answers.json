      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction process used to synthesize Methyl Mercaptan.",
      "answer": "Methyl mercaptan, also known as methanethiol or methyl thioether, is synthesized through a series of chemical reactions involving sulfur and carbon compounds. The primary method for synthesizing methyl mercaptan involves the reaction between hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and methanol (CH₃OH). Here's a step-by-step description of the process:\n\n### Step 1: Preparation of Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S)\nHydrogen sulfide can be produced by reacting sodium sulfide with sulfuric acid:\n\\[ \\text{Na}_2\\text{S} + \\text{H}_",
