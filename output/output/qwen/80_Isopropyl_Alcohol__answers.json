      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows Isopropyl Alcohol (2-Propanol). The key properties of Isopropyl Alcohol include:\n\n1. **Chemical Formula**: It has the formula C3H8O.\n2. **Molecular Structure**: It consists of three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom, arranged in a way that forms a secondary alcohol group (-OH) attached to a tertiary carbon atom.\n3. **Solvent Properties**: It dissolves many other organic compounds easily due to its polar nature, making it useful as a solvent for various substances such as gums, essential oils, alkal",

      "question": "Describe the industrial process used to produce isopropyl alcohol and identify the catalyst involved.",
      "answer": "Isopropyl alcohol, also known as 2-propanol or isopropanol, is produced industrially through a process called hydration of propene (also known as isobutylene). This process involves the addition of water to propene in the presence of a catalyst to form isopropyl alcohol.\n\n### Industrial Process:\n\n1. **Propene Production:**\n   - Propene is typically produced from n-butane or n-pentane by dehydrogenation.\n   - The reaction is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_{10} \\rightarrow \\text{",
