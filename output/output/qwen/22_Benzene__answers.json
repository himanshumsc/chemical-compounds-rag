      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is a cyclic hydrocarbon with six carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal ring, each carbon atom bonded to one hydrogen atom. Key properties of benzene include:\n\n1. **Stability**: Benzene is highly stable due to the delocalization of electrons across the ring, which makes it resistant to many chemical reactions.\n2. **Double Bonds**: The ring consists of alternating single and double bonds between the carbon atoms, which contributes to its stability.\n3. **Chemical Reactivity**: Despite its stability, benzene can undergo electrophilic aromatic",

      "question": "What is the molecular formula of benzene and what elements does it comprise?",
      "answer": "The molecular formula of benzene is \\( C_6H_6 \\). This means that one molecule of benzene consists of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms.\n\nBenzene is an organic compound with the chemical formula \\( C_6H_6 \\), which indicates that it is composed of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms. Specifically, each molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms.",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility properties of benzene and identify in which solvents it is soluble.",
      "answer": "Benzene, with its chemical formula C₆H₆, is an organic compound that exhibits unique solubility properties due to its aromatic structure and nonpolar nature.\n\n### Solubility Properties of Benzene\n\n1. **Nonpolar Nature**: Benzene is nonpolar because all of its carbon-carbon bonds are sigma bonds, and there are no polar bonds (such as C-H or C-C) that would contribute to polarity. This lack of polarity means that benzene does not interact strongly with polar solvents like water.\n\n2. **Aromatic Structure**: The six-membered ring of benzene contains",

      "question": "Explain why benzene's chemical structure was considered a mystery and how Friedrich August Kekulé contributed to understanding it.",
      "answer": "Benzene, with its distinctive aromatic properties, has been a subject of intense interest in organic chemistry for over two centuries. Its chemical structure was particularly intriguing because it did not conform to the simple alkane or alkenes structures that were well understood at the time. The key question was: what is the structure of benzene?\n\n### Historical Context\n\nIn the early 19th century, chemists had developed a theory called valence bond theory, which suggested that atoms form bonds by sharing electrons. However, benzene presented a challenge to this theory because it seemed to have fewer bonds than expected. For example, if benzene",
