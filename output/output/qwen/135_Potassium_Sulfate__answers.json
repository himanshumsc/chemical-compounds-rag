      "question": "Explain the solubility characteristics of potassium sulfate in different solvents.",
      "answer": "Potassium sulfate, also known as potash sulfate or potassium hydrogen sulfate, has distinct solubility characteristics when dissolved in various solvents. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for applications such as chemical synthesis, purification processes, and industrial uses.\n\n### Solubility in Water\nPotassium sulfate is highly soluble in water. It dissolves readily to form a clear solution. The solubility of potassium sulfate in water at 25°C (77°F) is approximately 100 grams per 100 mL of water. This means that you can dissolve up to 100 grams of potassium sulfate in 10",
