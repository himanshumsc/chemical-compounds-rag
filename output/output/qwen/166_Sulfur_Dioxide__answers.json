      "question": "What is the chemical formula of sulfur dioxide, and what elements does it contain?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for sulfur dioxide (SO₂) consists of one atom of sulfur (S) and two atoms of oxygen (O). Therefore, the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{S} + 2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{SO}_2 \\]\n\nSo, sulfur dioxide contains the elements sulfur and oxygen.",

      "question": "Describe the dual role of sulfur dioxide as an oxidizing and reducing agent.",
      "answer": "Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) plays a dual role in chemical reactions, acting both as an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent, depending on the context and the specific reaction conditions.\n\n### As an Oxidizing Agent:\nIn many cases, sulfur dioxide acts as an oxidizing agent because it can gain electrons or donate electron pairs to other substances. This behavior is due to its relatively low electronegativity compared to oxygen, which makes it more prone to losing electrons than gaining them. When sulfur dioxide reacts with substances that have a higher oxidation state, it can oxidize these substances by accepting electrons from them.\n\nFor example, in",

      "question": "Explain the process and significance of capturing sulfur dioxide as a byproduct during the smelting of metallic ores.",
      "answer": "The smelting of metallic ores is a process used to extract metals from their ores, typically through the reduction of metal oxides with carbon or other reducing agents. During this process, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is often produced as a byproduct due to the presence of sulfur in the ores.\n\n### Process of Capturing Sulfur Dioxide:\n\n1. **Ore Smelting:**\n   - Metallic ores contain various elements including sulfur. When these ores are heated in the presence of a reducing agent like carbon, the metal is extracted.\n   - The reaction can be simplified as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Metal",
