      "question": "Explain the phenomenon that occurs when luminol is combined with hydrogen peroxide and how it relates to forensic science.",
      "answer": "The phenomenon you're referring to is known as chemiluminescence, specifically the reaction between luminol (a chemical compound) and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an oxidizing agent like iron(III) ions or copper(II) ions. This reaction is widely used in forensic science for detecting bloodstains.\n\n### Mechanism of the Reaction:\n\n1. **Luminol Structure**: Luminol is a fluorescent compound that can be excited by light or other energy sources.\n2. **Hydrogen Peroxide**: Hydrogen peroxide acts as a source of oxygen radicals.\n3. **Oxidizing Agent",

      "question": "Discuss why the boiling point of Luminol is listed as 'not applicable' and what this indicates about its stability at high temperatures.",
      "answer": "The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas under standard atmospheric pressure. For many substances, including most organic compounds, this temperature can be determined through experimental methods such as distillation or boiling point determination. However, for certain substances, particularly those that are highly unstable or decompose before reaching their boiling point, the boiling point may not be applicable.\n\nLuminol (3-Aminophthalhydrazide) is a chemical compound used in forensic science for detecting bloodstains due to its ability to emit light when exposed to oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide. Its boiling point is",
