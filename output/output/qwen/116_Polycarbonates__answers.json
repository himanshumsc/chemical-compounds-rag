      "question": "What are the key elements that make up polycarbonates, and what is their state at room temperature?",
      "answer": "Polycarbonates are a type of thermoplastic polymer. They are made by the condensation polymerization of bisphenol A (BPA) with phosgene or carbon dioxide. The key elements that make up polycarbonates include:\n\n1. Bisphenol A (BPA): This is a monomer used in the production of polycarbonate. It is a colorless, crystalline solid with a molecular weight of approximately 228 g/mol.\n\n2. Phosgene: This is a toxic gas used as a reagent in the production of polycarbonate. It has a molecular weight of",
