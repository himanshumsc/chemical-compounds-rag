      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). Sodium hydroxide is a strong base with several key properties:\n\n1. **Appearance**: It appears as a white or colorless solid.\n2. **Solubility**: It is highly soluble in water, forming a strongly basic solution.\n3. **Concentration**: Solutions of sodium hydroxide can be very concentrated due to its high solubility.\n4. **Reactivity**: It reacts vigorously with acids, neutralizing them and producing salts and water.\n5. **Corrosive**: Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to skin and tissue,",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula for sodium hydroxide and what elements does it contain?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for sodium hydroxide is NaOH. It contains two elements: sodium (Na) and oxygen (O). The hydrogen (H) is present in the compound but is not part of the main structure of sodium hydroxide; it is simply ionized in water to form hydronium ions (H3O+).",

      "question": "Explain why sodium hydroxide is considered a deliquescent solid and its implications.",
      "answer": "Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), also known as lye, is considered a deliquescent solid because it readily absorbs moisture from the air to form a solution or paste. This property arises due to the strong polarity of water and the basic nature of NaOH.\n\n### Mechanism of Deliquescence:\n1. **Polar Nature of Water**: Water molecules have a polar structure with a partial negative charge at one end and a partial positive charge at the other. This polarity allows water to interact strongly with other polar substances.\n2. **Basicity of Sodium Hydroxide**: Sodium hydroxide is a strong base,",

      "question": "Describe the process by which sodium hydroxide is commercially produced and its relation to chlorine gas.",
      "answer": "Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), also known as lye, is commonly produced through two main industrial processes: the Solvay process and the electrolysis of brine.\n\n### 1. **Solvay Process**\nThe Solvay process, developed in the late 19th century, is a method for producing sodium carbonate (soda ash) from salt and ammonia. Sodium hydroxide is a byproduct of this process:\n\n- **Ingredients**: Sodium chloride (table salt), ammonia, and carbon dioxide.\n- **Process**:\n  - Ammonia is passed over heated sodium chloride to produce sodium chloride",
