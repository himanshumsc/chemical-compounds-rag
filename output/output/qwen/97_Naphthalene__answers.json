      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of naphthalene?",
      "answer": "Naphthalene is an aromatic hydrocarbon with the chemical formula \\( C_{10}H_8 \\). To find its molecular weight, we need to sum the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe atomic weight of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.\nThe atomic weight of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008 g/mol.\n\nNow, calculate the total weight for each element:\n- For carbon: \\( 10 \\times 12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 120.1 \\, \\text",

      "question": "Describe the solubility properties of naphthalene and explain what solvents it is soluble in.",
      "answer": "Naphthalene is a crystalline solid with a molecular formula of C10H8, which corresponds to two benzene rings fused together. It has a melting point of 80.2°C (176.4°F) and a boiling point of 218°C (424°F). Naphthalene is highly soluble in organic solvents but not in water.\n\n### Solubility Properties:\n- **Solubility in Water:** Naphthalene is **insoluble** in water. This is because water is a polar solvent, while naphthalene is nonpolar due",

      "question": "Explain the significance of naphthalene being an aromatic hydrocarbon and discuss its structural composition.",
      "answer": "Naphthalene is a well-known aromatic hydrocarbon, which means it contains a ring structure with alternating single and double bonds that delocalize electrons across the ring, giving it unique chemical properties.\n\n### Significance of Naphthalene Being an Aromatic Hydrocarbon:\n\n1. **Aromatic Character**: The aromatic character of naphthalene arises from the delocalization of electrons in the ring. This delocalization makes the molecule more stable than would be expected for a non-aromatic compound with the same number of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms. This stability is due to the fact that the electrons are spread out over the entire",
