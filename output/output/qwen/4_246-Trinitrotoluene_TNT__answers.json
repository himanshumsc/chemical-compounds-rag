      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows 2,4,6 Trinitrotoluene (TNT). TNT is a powerful explosive with several key properties:\n\n1. **Chemical Composition**: TNT consists of a toluene molecule with three nitro groups (-NO2) attached at positions 2, 4, and 6 on the benzene ring.\n   - Red atoms represent oxygen.\n   - White atoms represent hydrogen.\n   - Black atoms represent carbon.\n   - Blue atoms represent nitrogen.\n\n2. **Physical Properties**:\n   - TNT is a white crystalline solid.\n   - It has a melting point of",

      "question": "What is the molecular formula and molecular weight of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT)?",
      "answer": "The molecular formula for 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is C7H5N3O6.\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of TNT, we need to sum the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 7 = 84.07 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 5 = 5.04 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 3 = 42.03 g",

      "question": "Explain why TNT is considered a relatively safe explosive to handle compared to other explosives.",
      "answer": "TNT (Trinitrotoluene) is often considered safer to handle than some other explosives due to its relatively low sensitivity to external stimuli such as heat, friction, and impact. This means that TNT requires a higher energy input to detonate compared to many other explosives.\n\nHere are the key reasons why TNT is considered relatively safe:\n\n1. **High Sensitivity to Impact**: TNT has a high degree of sensitivity to impact. It requires a significant amount of force to initiate an explosion. This makes it less likely to accidentally detonate from minor impacts or vibrations.\n\n2. **Moderate Sensitivity to Heat**: TNT is moderately sensitive to",

      "question": "Discuss how TNT's solubility properties affect its applications and handling.",
      "answer": "TNT (Trinitrotoluene) is a powerful explosive with unique solubility properties that significantly influence its applications and handling.\n\n### Solubility Properties of TNT\n\n1. **Insoluble in Water**: TNT is highly insoluble in water, which means it does not dissolve even when mixed with water. This property makes it difficult to clean up spills or residues after use.\n2. **Soluble in Organic Solvents**: TNT is soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol, acetone, and chloroform. This characteristic allows for easier extraction and purification during manufacturing processes.\n\n### Applications Influenced by TNT's Solub",
