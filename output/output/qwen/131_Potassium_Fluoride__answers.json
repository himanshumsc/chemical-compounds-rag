      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Potassium Fluoride?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Potassium Fluoride (KF) is simply KF, where K represents potassium and F represents fluorine.\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of KF, we need to sum the atomic weights of its constituent elements:\n\n- The atomic weight of potassium (K) is approximately 39.10 g/mol.\n- The atomic weight of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.99 g/mol.\n\nSo, the molecular weight of KF is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Molecular weight of KF} = 39.10 \\, \\text{g/mol}",

      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of Potassium Fluoride in different solvents.",
      "answer": "Potassium fluoride (KF) is an ionic compound, meaning it dissociates into its constituent ions when dissolved in water or other polar solvents. The solubility of KF in various solvents can be understood by considering the nature of these solvents and their interactions with the ions.\n\n### Solubility in Water:\n- **Solubility**: Potassium fluoride is highly soluble in water.\n- **Reason**: Water is a polar solvent that can effectively solvate the ionic species (K⁺ and F⁻). The strong hydrogen bonding network in water helps to stabilize the ions, making KF highly soluble.\n\n### Sol",
