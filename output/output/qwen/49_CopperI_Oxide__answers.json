      "question": "Describe the stability and transformation behavior of Copper(I) Oxide in different air conditions.",
      "answer": "Copper(I) oxide, also known as cuprous oxide (Cu₂O), is a compound with a unique structure and chemical properties that make it sensitive to changes in its environment. Its stability and transformation behavior can be influenced by various factors such as temperature, humidity, and exposure to oxygen.\n\n### Stability in Air\n\n1. **Initial State**: In dry air at room temperature, Cu₂O is relatively stable. It does not readily react with oxygen or other gases under these conditions.\n2. **Humidity**: When exposed to humid air, Cu₂O can undergo a transformation process. The presence of water vapor can cause the compound",
