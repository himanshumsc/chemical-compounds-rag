      "question": "Describe the different structural forms of Silicon Dioxide and how they differ.",
      "answer": "Silicon dioxide (SiO₂), commonly known as silica, is a compound that plays a crucial role in various natural and industrial processes due to its unique properties. It exists in several structural forms, each with distinct characteristics. The most common forms include quartz, cristobalite, tridymite, and moganite.\n\n1. **Quartz (SiO₂)**:\n   - **Structure**: Quartz is one of the most well-known forms of SiO₂. It crystallizes in the trigonal system and has a three-dimensional network structure where each silicon atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by four oxygen atoms,",

      "question": "Explain how silicon dioxide's solubility varies and under what conditions it can dissolve.",
      "answer": "Silicon dioxide (SiO₂), commonly known as silica, is a non-metallic element that forms the backbone of many minerals and rocks. It is highly insoluble in water and most other common solvents at room temperature and standard pressure. However, there are specific conditions under which SiO₂ can dissolve.\n\n### Solubility in Water\nSilicon dioxide is essentially insoluble in pure water at room temperature. The solubility of SiO₂ in water is extremely low, typically less than 1 mg/L at 25°C. This means that even if you were to mix a large amount of SiO₂ with",
