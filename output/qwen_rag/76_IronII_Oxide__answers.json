      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Iron(II) Oxide?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Iron(II) Oxide is FeO. Iron(II) Oxide is also commonly known as ferrous oxide or iron(I) oxide. The molecular weight of FeO is calculated as follows:\n\n- Atomic weight of Iron (Fe): 55.845 g/mol\n- Atomic weight of Oxygen (O): 15.9994 g/mol\n\nThus, the molecular weight of FeO is:\n\\[ 55.845 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 15.9994 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 71.8444 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nIron(II) Oxide is an inorganic compound with a pale red color. It is insoluble in water but soluble in acids, such as hydrochloric acid. It finds use in various applications, including:\n\n- In coatings and pigments\n- As a catalyst in industrial processes\n- In the production of steel and iron alloys\n- As a pigment in paints and coatings\n\nIt is important to note that Iron(II) Oxide is chemically inactive and is not toxic. However, exposure to dust or fine particles of FeO can cause respiratory irritation in individuals with respiratory sensitivities. Handling should be done with care to avoid inhaling the dust. For further safety information, refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or consult with a chemical safety professional.\n\nIf you need more detailed information on Iron(II) Oxide, such as its physical properties, chemical reactions it undergoes, or its role in specific processes, further documentation or sources would be helpful.",

      "question": "What are the solubility properties of Iron(II) Oxide and how does it react with other compounds?",
      "answer": "Iron(II) oxide, also known as Ferrous oxide or Iron(II) hydroxide, has several solubility properties and reacts with various compounds in specific ways. Below is a detailed explanation of these properties based on the provided context.\n\n### Solubility Properties\n\nIron(II) oxide, FeO, is an insoluble compound in water, but it can react with acids to form soluble salts. Specifically, iron(II) oxide reacts with acid solutions (like hydrochloric acid, HCl or sulfuric acid, H₂SO₄) to form iron(II) chloride (FeCl₂) or iron(II) sulfate (FeSO₄) respectively.\n\nFor example:\n\\[ FeO + 2HCl \\rightarrow FeCl_{2} + H_{2}O \\]\n\nThis reaction shows that iron(II) oxide dissolves in hydrochloric acid to form iron(II) chloride and water. This behavior is typical for oxides in reactions with acids.\n\n### Reactions with Other Compounds\n\n1. **Reaction with Acids:**\n   Iron(II) oxide reacts with various acids to form soluble iron(II) salts:\n   \\[ FeO + 2HCl \\rightarrow FeCl_{2} + H_{2}O \\]\n   \\[ FeO + H_{2}SO_{4} \\rightarrow FeSO_{4} + H_{2}O \\]\n\n2. **Reaction with Oxidizing Agents:**\n   Iron(II) oxide can be oxidized to iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) by strong oxidizing agents like nitric acid (HNO₃):\n   \\[ 2FeO + 4HNO₃ \\rightarrow 2Fe(NO₃)₂ + 2NO ↑ + 2H₂O \\]\n\n3. **Reaction with Reducing Agents:**\n   Iron(II) oxide can be reduced to iron(II) metal under specific conditions. For example, it can be reduced by hydrogen gas (H₂):\n   \\[ FeO + H₂ \\rightarrow Fe + H₂O \\]\n\n### Safety Information\n\nIron(II) oxide itself is not highly hazardous, but it can produce dust particles when handled, which can be a respiratory irritant. When handling iron(II) oxide, it is recommended to use protective equipment such as gloves and a dust mask to avoid inhaling the",

      "question": "How is Iron(II) Oxide prepared synthetically and what impurity may be present in the product?",
      "answer": "The question asks about the preparation of Iron(II) oxide, also known as ferrous oxide (FeO), and the potential impurities in the product. Based on the information provided, let's address the preparation and impurities of FeO.\n\n### Preparation of Iron(II) Oxide (FeO)\n\nIron(II) oxide, or ferrous oxide, can be prepared synthetically through various methods. One of the most common methods is through the reduction of ferric oxide (Fe2O3) or iron(III) oxide in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) under high temperature conditions. This process is known as the Smelting of Iron.\n\nThe reaction can be represented as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3 + 3\\text{CO} \\rightarrow 2\\text{FeO} + 3\\text{CO}_2 \\]\n\nAnother method involves reducing ferric oxide with hydrogen gas (H2) at a high temperature, but this method is less common due to the safety concerns associated with working with hydrogen.\n\n\\[ \\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3 + \\text{H}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{FeO} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\n### Potential Impurities in the Product\n\nThe purity of FeO can be affected by the quality of the reactants and the conditions under which the reaction is carried out. Common impurities that might be present in the product include:\n\n1. **Iron(III)oxide (Fe2O3)**: This impurity is most likely to be present because it may be difficult to completely reduce Fe2O3 to FeO. The reaction may not go to completion, leading to a mixture of FeO and Fe2O3.\n2. **Iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3)**: If the reaction conditions are not carefully controlled, Fe(OH)3 can form as a result of the reduction process, particularly if there is excess water present in the reaction mixture.\n3. **Carbon monoxide (CO)**: If the reaction is conducted in an environment with excess CO, FeO can react with CO to form Fe and CO2, leaving a trace amount of Fe.\n4. **Hydrogen gas (H2)**: If the reaction is conducted with H2, a small amount of Fe can remain due to incomplete",
