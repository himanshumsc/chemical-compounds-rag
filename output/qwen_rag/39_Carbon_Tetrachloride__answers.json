      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Carbon Tetrachloride?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Carbon Tetrachloride (C\\(_4\\)Cl\\(_4\\)) does not exist in its pure form; instead, it is commonly represented as CHCl\\(_2\\) (chloroform). However, for completeness, let's consider the information provided in the sources:\n\n1. **Source 1**:\n   - The source does not provide any information about Carbon Tetrachloride specifically. It only discusses terms such as Carbohydrates, Carboxyl Groups, Carcinogen, Catalysts, Cathodes, Cations, Caustics, Centrifuge, Chelate, Chemiluminescence, Chiral, Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCS), and Chemical Compounds.\n\n2. **Source 2**:\n   - There is a mention of Alpha-Tocopherol (vitamin E). The chemical structure provided is not relevant to Carbon Tetrachloride, and the molecular weight is incorrect for it. This source seems to be about a different compound.\n\n3. **Source 3**:\n   - The source talks about Acetaminophen, which is unrelated to Carbon Tetrachloride.\n\n4. **Source 4**:\n   - The sources discuss terms such as Hydrocarbons, Hydrogenation, Hydrolysis, Incomplete Combustion, Inert, Inorganic, Ion, Ionic Bond, Ionic Compound, Isomer, Isotope, Krebs Cycle, etc., but none of these terms or compounds represent Carbon Tetrachloride.\n\n5. **Source 5**:\n   - The source discusses Acetylene (ethylene). \n\nGiven the lack of relevant information in the provided sources, it appears that the information about Carbon Tetrachloride is not directly included in these sources. To answer the user's question about the chemical formula and molecular weight of Carbon Tetrachloride, we would need a source that specifically addresses this compound.\n\n### Additional Information Needed:\nTo provide accurate information about the chemical formula and molecular weight of Carbon Tetrachloride:\n\n1. **Chemical Formula**: CHCl\\(_2\\)\n2. **Molecular Weight**: 119.52 g/mol\n\nIf you need any further details or have additional sources that mention Carbon Tetrachloride, please share them, and I can provide a comprehensive response.",

      "question": "Why is Carbon Tetrachloride classified as a halogenated hydrocarbon?",
      "answer": "Carbon tetracloride (CCl4) is classified as a halogenated hydrocarbon due to its molecular structure, which consists of a carbon atom bonded to four chlorine atoms. To understand this classification, let's break down the nature of halogenated hydrocarbons and the specific characteristics of carbon tetracloride.\n\n### Halogenated Hydrocarbons\nHalogenated hydrocarbons are organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon are substituted by halogen atoms. Common halogens in this context are chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).\n\n### Properties and Structure of Carbon Tetrachloride\n- **Formula**: CCl4\n- **Elements**: Carbon (C) and Chlorine (Cl)\n- **Compound Type**: Organic\n- **State**: Liquid at room temperature\n- **Molecular Weight**: 152.81 g/mol\n- **Melting Point**: -22.4 °C ( -9 °F)\n- **Boiling Point**: 76.8 °C (170.2 °F)\n- **Solubility**: Soluble in organic solvents\n\n### Classification as a Halogenated Hydrocarbon\nCarbon tetrachloride (CCl4) fits the definition of a halogenated hydrocarbon because:\n- It has a carbon atom in its structure.\n- Four of the hydrogen atoms in the methane (CH4) structure are replaced by chlorine atoms.\n- Chlorine is one of the halogen atoms, which are oxygen, fluorine, bromine, and iodine.\n\n### Uses of Carbon Tetrachloride\nCarbon tetrachloride has been used in various applications, but its use has been limited due to safety concerns:\n- **Solvent**: Used as a solvent in some industrial processes.\n- **Fire Extinguishing Agent**: It has been used as a fire extinguishing agent, but its use is now restricted due to safety concerns.\n\n### Safety Information\nCarbon tetrachloride is considered toxic and should be handled with care. It can cause serious health issues if ingested, inhaled, or come into contact with the skin. Exposure to carbon tetrachloride can lead to:\n- **Acute Toxicity**: Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and headaches.\n- **Chronic Toxicity**: Long-term exposure can",

      "question": "Discuss the historical applications of Carbon Tetrachloride and the reasons for the decline in its usage.",
      "answer": "Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl₄) is a chlorinated hydrocarbon with a chemical formula of CCl₄. It is a colorless, non-flammable liquid with a sweet odor. Historically, it was used as a solvent, a fire extinguishing agent, and a cleaning agent. However, its use has declined due to concerns about its environmental impacts and its toxicological properties.\n\n**Historical Applications:**\n\n- **Solvent:** Carbon Tetrachloride was widely used as a solvent due to its effectiveness in dissolving fats and oils. It was popular in the manufacturing of textiles, where it was used to clean fabrics and improve their quality. Additionally, it was used in the production of adhesives and paints.\n- **Fire Extinguishing Agent:** Because of its non-flammability, Carbon Tetrachloride was used in firefighting equipment, particularly in areas where electrical fires or flammable liquids were present. However, its use in fire extinguishers has been discontinued due to environmental concerns.\n- **Cleaning Agent:** It was also used as a cleaning agent in various industries, including the cleaning of machinery and the degreasing of metal parts.\n\n**Reasons for Decline in Usage:**\n\n- **Environmental Concerns:** The primary reason for the decline in the use of Carbon Tetrachloride is its harmful impact on the environment. Specifically, it contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer. The ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. The loss of ozone due to the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other substances, including Carbon Tetrachloride, was discovered in the 1970s, leading to international efforts to reduce the production and use of these substances. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed, which aimed to phase out the production and use of substances that deplete the ozone layer, including Carbon Tetrachloride.\n- **Toxicological Properties:** Carbon Tetrachloride is toxic when inhaled or ingested. It can cause liver damage and neurological effects, particularly in high concentrations. Although its use as a solvent and cleaning agent is less common nowadays, it still poses risks in industrial settings where it could be released into the environment or come into contact with workers.\n- **Safety Regulations:** Due to its toxicity and potential for environmental harm",
