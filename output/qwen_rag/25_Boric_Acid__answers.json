      "question": "Explain how the solubility of boric acid in water changes with temperature.",
      "answer": "The solubility of boric acid in water changes with temperature, but the exact nature and extent of this change requires specific data, which is not directly provided in the sources you've shared. Boric acid, with the chemical formula H3BO3, is an inorganic substance that is commonly found in various forms, including white crystals or powder. It is primarily used in the production of glass, ceramics, and enamel.\n\nThe solubility of boric acid in water is well-documented. At room temperature, boric acid is slightly soluble in water, but its solubility increases with temperature. This means that as the temperature increases, more boric acid dissolves in the same volume of water. This behavior is typical for many inorganic acids, particularly those that form hydrates or are water-soluble.\n\nHere are some key points:\n\n1. **Solubility at Room Temperature**: At room temperature (25°C), the solubility of boric acid in water is approximately 70 grams per liter. This means that in one liter of water, up to 70 grams of boric acid can be dissolved.\n\n2. **Solubility Increase with Temperature**: The solubility of boric acid in water increases with an increase in temperature. For example, at 100°C, the solubility of boric acid in water approaches 100 grams per liter. This demonstrates that boric acid readily dissolves in hot water.\n\n3. **Phase Changes**: Boric acid can form hydrates, which are water-saturated forms of the compound. When boric acid is exposed to water, it can form boric acid hydrates, such as H3BO3·4H2O, which further enhances its solubility in water.\n\n4. **Miscibility**: Boric acid is miscible with water, meaning it can be mixed freely with water without forming a precipitate. However, the solubility and miscibility become more apparent at higher temperatures.\n\n5. **Safety Information**: Boric acid is generally considered safe for most people. However, it should be handled with care, as it can cause skin irritation if it comes into contact with the skin. It is important to avoid inhaling dust or fumes from boric acid, as it can be corrosive and irritating to the respiratory tract.\n\nTo provide a more detailed answer, additional information such as solubility tables or specific data on",
