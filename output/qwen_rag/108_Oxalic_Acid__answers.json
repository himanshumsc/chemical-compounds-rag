      "question": "Explain how the synthesis of oxalic acid by Friedrich Wöhler contributed to the development of chemistry.",
      "answer": "Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of oxalic acid, a compound that is chemically similar to a number of other common organic acids, played a significant role in the development of organic chemistry in the mid-19th century. This discovery not only highlighted the complexity and diversity of organic compounds but also demonstrated the potential for organic compounds to be synthesized from simpler inorganic compounds. This work paved the way for future advancements in understanding organic chemistry and its practical applications.\n\n### Synthesis of Oxalic Acid\n\n**Formula:** Oxalic acid (HOOC-COOH)\n\nOxalic acid is a二carboxylic acid, meaning it has two carboxyl groups. It is a powerful organic acid, which means it can undergo a range of chemical reactions with other compounds. Wöhler's synthesis of oxalic acid involved starting with the amino acid **glycine** (NH₂-CH₂-COOH), which was known at the time.\n\nThe process involved reacting glycinewith a solution of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), which resulted in the precipitation of calcium oxalate (CaC₂O₄). This reaction could be considered a reverse synthesis pathway, where glycine was modified to form calcium oxalate, which was then converted back into oxalic acid. The specific reaction can be described as:\n\n\\[ \\text{NH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{COOH} + \\text{Ca(OH)}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{CaC}_2\\text{O}_4 + \\text{NH}_4\\text{OH} \\]\n\nThe calcium oxalate precipitate was then dissolved in a dilute acid solution to liberate oxalic acid:\n\n\\[ \\text{CaC}_2\\text{O}_4 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4 + \\text{Ca}(\\text{OH})_2 \\]\n\nThis synthesis demonstrated that organic compounds, which were previously thought to require living organisms for their formation, could actually be synthesized from inorganic materials under the right conditions.\n\n### Impact on Chemistry\n\nWöhler's synthesis of oxalic acid was significant because it led to a broader understanding of the chemical constitution of organic substances and the possibility that organic substances",
