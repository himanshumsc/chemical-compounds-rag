      "question": "Explain why L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester is considered a dipeptide and how it compares to sucrose in terms of sweetness and caloric content.",
      "answer": "The compound L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester is considered a dipeptide because it consists of two amino acids (L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine) linked together by a peptide bond. Dipeptides are a class of dipeptides, which are themselves a class of peptidic compounds.\n\n**Formation of Dipeptide:**\nA dipeptide is formed by a condensation reaction, where the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid undergo a dehydration reaction to form a single peptide bond. The resulting structure is:\n\n\\[ \\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{N}-\\text{CH}-\\text{COOH} \\text{ (aspartic acid)} \\]\n\\[ \\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{N}-\\text{CH}-\\text{COOH} \\text{ (phenylalanine)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{N}-\\text{CH}-\\text{COOH} \\text{ (phenylalanine)} \\]\n\\[ \\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{N}-\\text{CH}-\\text{COOH} \\text{ (aspartic acid)} \\]\n\nThe resulting dipeptide is:\n\n\\[ \\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{N}-\\text{CH}-\\text{COOH} \\text{ (phenylalanine)} \\]\n\\[ \\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{N}-\\text{CH}-\\text{COOH} \\text{ (aspartic acid)} \\]\n\n**Sweetness and Caloric Content:**\nSucrose (table sugar) and L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester (aspartame) are both sweeteners, but they are quite different in their chemical structure, sweetness, and caloric content.\n\n- **Sucrose (C12H22O11):**\n  Sucrose is a simple sugar composed of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. It is a non-nutritive sweetener, meaning it does not contain any calories.\n\n- **L-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester (C14H1",
