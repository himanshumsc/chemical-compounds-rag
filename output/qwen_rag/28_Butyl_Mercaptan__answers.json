      "question": "Explain the concept of isomers in the context of butyl mercaptan and name its three isomers.",
      "answer": "Isomers are molecules that have the same chemical formula but different physical structures and therefore different properties. This concept is particularly important in organic chemistry, where the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule can significantly affect its behavior.\n\n### Butyl Mercaptan\n\nButyl mercaptan (chemical formula: \\( \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7\\text{SH} \\)) is a derivative of mercaptan, which is a chemical compound that contains a sulfur–hydrogen bond. Mercaptans are sulfur analogs of alcohols. Butyl mercaptan is one of the isomers of this compound, and it is a gas with a characteristic odor. It is a colorless gas with a mild, slightly sweet odor and is used in various industrial applications.\n\n### Isomers of Butyl Mercaptan\n\nTo determine the isomers of butyl mercaptan, we need to consider the possible arrangements of the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the \\( \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7\\text{SH} \\) structure. However, it's important to note that the sulfur atom in mercaptans cannot form double or triple bonds, as can nitrogen in amine compounds. Therefore, mercaptans are typically alkanes, alkenes, or alkynes, depending on the number of carbon atoms and the substitution pattern.\n\nGiven the chemical formula \\( \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7\\text{SH} \\), we need to identify the possible isomers. Since mercaptans do not form additional bonds due to sulfur's valence, we focus on the spatial arrangement of the carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Identifying Three Isomers\n\n1. **Butyl Mercaptan (1-butanol mercaptan)**: The simplest isomer is butyl mercaptan itself, which has the structure \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH} \\). This is the most common form of butyl mercaptan and has the chemical formula \\( \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{SH} \\).\n\n2. **Isobutyl Mercaptan**: This isomer is derived from isobutane. The structure is \\( \\text{(CH}_3\\text{CHCH}_3)\\text{SH} \\), or \\( \\text",
