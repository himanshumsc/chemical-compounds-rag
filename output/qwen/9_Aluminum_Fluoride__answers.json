      "question": "How does Aluminum Fluoride behave in terms of solubility in various solvents?",
      "answer": "Aluminum fluoride (AlF₃) is a salt that exhibits different behaviors in various solvents due to its structure and the nature of the solvent. Here's an overview of how AlF₃ behaves in different solvents:\n\n### 1. **Water**\n- **Solubility**: Aluminum fluoride is highly soluble in water.\n- **Behavior**: In aqueous solutions, AlF₃ dissociates into aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and fluoride ions (F⁻). This dissociation can be described by the following equation:\n  \\[\n  \\text{AlF}_3 + 3\\text{H}_",
