      "question": "Why was 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, also known as ibuprofen, developed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication?",
      "answer": "Ibuprofen, or 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was developed to provide relief from pain and inflammation. Its development can be traced back to the discovery of salicylates in the late 19th century, which were found to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nThe development of ibuprofen specifically was influenced by several factors:\n\n1. **Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR):** Researchers began to explore the structure of existing NSAIDs like aspirin and salicylic acid to understand how changes in",

      "question": "Given that 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point, what implications does this have for its storage and use in pharmaceutical applications?",
      "answer": "The decomposition of 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid (IBUP) above its melting point has several important implications for its storage and use in pharmaceutical applications:\n\n1. **Stability at Room Temperature**: Since IBUP decomposes above its melting point, it is crucial to store the compound below its melting point to prevent decomposition. This means that it should be stored at room temperature or slightly below.\n\n2. **Avoidance of Heat Exposure**: During handling, storage, and use, care must be taken to avoid exposing the compound to temperatures that exceed its melting point. This includes avoiding direct sunlight, high",
