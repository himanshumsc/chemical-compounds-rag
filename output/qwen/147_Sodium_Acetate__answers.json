      "question": "Discuss why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and describe its physical properties that make it suitable for this application.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate, also known as sodium ethanoate or sodium ethanoate, is a salt of acetic acid and sodium hydroxide. It is widely used in the textile industry due to several advantageous properties that make it suitable for various applications.\n\n### Uses in the Textile Industry\n\n1. **Dyeing Process**: Sodium acetate is often used as a co-solvent in dyeing processes. It helps to dissolve dyes more effectively, ensuring better color penetration into the fabric fibers. This enhances the vibrancy and longevity of colors.\n\n2. **Fixation of Dyes**: After dyeing, sodium acet",
