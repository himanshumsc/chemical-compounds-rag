      "question": "What is the chemical formula of Potassium Chloride and its molecular weight?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Potassium Chloride (KCl) is simply KCl, which indicates one potassium ion (K⁺) and one chloride ion (Cl⁻).\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of KCl:\n\n- The atomic weight of Potassium (K) is approximately 39.10 g/mol.\n- The atomic weight of Chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\nAdding these together gives us the molecular weight of KCl:\n\\[ \\text{Molecular Weight of KCl} = 39.10 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 35.",

      "question": "Explain the significance of Potassium Chloride in agriculture and its natural occurrence.",
      "answer": "Potassium Chloride (KCl) is an essential nutrient for plants, playing a crucial role in their growth and development. It is one of the three macronutrients that plants require in large quantities, along with nitrogen and phosphorus. The other two are calcium, magnesium, and sulfur.\n\n### Significance of Potassium Chloride in Agriculture\n\n1. **Stress Resistance**: Potassium helps plants resist stress from various environmental factors such as drought, salinity, and temperature extremes. It also enhances resistance to diseases and pests.\n   \n2. **Leaf Development**: Potassium promotes leaf size and number, which can increase photosynthesis",
