      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Aluminum Oxide?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for aluminum oxide is Al₂O₃. \n\nTo calculate its molecular weight, we need to sum the atomic weights of all the atoms in the formula:\n\n- The atomic weight of aluminum (Al) is approximately 26.98 g/mol.\n- The atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.\n\nFor Al₂O₃:\n- There are 2 aluminum atoms: \\(2 \\times 26.98 = 53.96\\) g/mol.\n- There are 3 oxygen atoms: \\(3 \\times 16.0",

      "question": "How is Aluminum Oxide produced from bauxite?",
      "answer": "Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), also known as alumina, is a key intermediate in the production of aluminum metal. The process of producing aluminum oxide from bauxite involves several steps:\n\n### 1. **Bauxite Mining**\n   Bauxite is primarily composed of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) mixed with other minerals such as iron oxide (Fe2O3) and silica (SiO2). It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\n### 2. **Crushing and Grinding**\n   The bauxite ore is first crushed to reduce its size and then ground into a fine powder",

      "question": "Explain why Aluminum Oxide is suitable for use in abrasives and refractory products.",
      "answer": "Aluminum oxide, also known as alumina, is widely used in various applications due to its unique properties that make it suitable for abrasives and refractory products. Here’s an explanation of why aluminum oxide is suitable for these uses:\n\n### 1. **High Hardness**\nAluminum oxide has one of the highest hardnesses among all minerals. Its hardness on the Mohs scale ranges from 9 to 9.5, which makes it highly resistant to wear and tear. This high hardness ensures that aluminum oxide-based abrasives can effectively remove material without degrading quickly.\n\n### 2. **Chemical Stability**\nAluminum oxide",
