      "question": "Explain how Potassium Bitartrate is produced and name one of its historical uses.",
      "answer": "Potassium bitartrate, also known as potassium acid tartrate or potassium oxalate, is a compound with the chemical formula KHC4H4O6·3H2O. It is produced through a process that involves the reaction of tartaric acid (C4H4O6) with potassium hydroxide (KOH). Tartaric acid is naturally found in grapes and other fruits, while potassium hydroxide is a strong base.\n\nThe production process typically involves dissolving tartaric acid in water and then adding potassium hydroxide to this solution. The reaction produces potassium bitartrate",
