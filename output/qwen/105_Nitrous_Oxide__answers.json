      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows Nitrous Oxide (N₂O). Key properties of Nitrous Oxide include:\n\n1. **Chemical Composition**: It consists of two nitrogen atoms (N) and one oxygen atom (O), bonded together.\n2. **Triple Bond**: The nitrogen atoms share a triple bond, which is a strong covalent bond involving three pairs of electrons.\n3. **Color**: In the diagram, the red sphere represents an oxygen atom, while the blue spheres represent nitrogen atoms.\n4. **Physical Properties**:\n   - **Boiling Point**: -89°C (-128°F",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Nitrous Oxide?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Nitrous Oxide (also known as笑气 in Chinese) is \\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O} \\).\n\nTo calculate its molecular weight, we need to sum the atomic weights of each element present in the molecule:\n\n- Nitrogen (\\(\\text{N}\\)): The atomic weight of nitrogen is approximately 14.01 g/mol.\n- Oxygen (\\(\\text{O}\\)): The atomic weight of oxygen is approximately 16.00 g/mol.\n\nNow, we multiply these atomic weights by the number of atoms of each element in the formula:\n- There are two nitrogen",

      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of Nitrous Oxide and its implications for usage.",
      "answer": "Nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas or nitrous acid (HNO₂), is a colorless, odorless, and sweet-tasting gas that is widely used in various fields due to its unique properties.\n\n### Solubility Properties:\n1. **Physical State**: Nitrous oxide is a gas at room temperature and pressure.\n2. **Solubility in Water**: Nitrous oxide is highly soluble in water. This property makes it useful in medical settings where it can be dissolved in saline solutions to create a mixture called \"Naropain\" which is used for pain relief during minor surgical procedures.\n3. **Sol",

      "question": "Discuss the historical discovery and early experimentation of Nitrous Oxide.",
      "answer": "Nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas or nitrous acid, is a colorless, odorless, and sweet-tasting gas that has been used for centuries in various contexts, including as anesthetic, analgesic, and recreational drug.\n\nThe historical discovery of nitrous oxide can be traced back to the late 18th century. In 1772, Joseph Priestley, an English chemist and clergyman, discovered the compound while experimenting with air and water. He named it \"nitrous acid\" because he believed it was composed of nitrogen and oxygen. However, Priestley did not fully understand the properties",
