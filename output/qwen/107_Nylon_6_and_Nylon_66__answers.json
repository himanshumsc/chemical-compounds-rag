      "question": "Explain the difference between thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting plastics in the context of Nylon 6 and Nylon 66.",
      "answer": "Thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting plastics are two distinct categories of plastics, each with different properties and applications. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the right material for specific applications.\n\n### Thermoplastic Polymers\n\n**Definition:**\nThermoplastic polymers are materials that can be repeatedly melted and reshaped without changing their chemical structure. They have a glass transition temperature (Tg) below room temperature, which means they remain in a solid state at room temperature but can be softened and deformed when heated above this temperature.\n\n**Properties:**\n- **Meltability:** Can be melted and reformed.",
