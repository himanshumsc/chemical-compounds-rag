      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of menthol?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for menthol is \\( \\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{20}\\text{O} \\).\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight, we sum the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, multiply each by the number of atoms in the formula:\n- \\( 10 \\times 12.01 = 120.1 \\) g/mol",
