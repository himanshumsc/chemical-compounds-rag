      "question": "What is the chemical formula of 1,3-butadiene, and what type of compound is it?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for 1,3-butadiene is C4H6. It is an unsaturated hydrocarbon, specifically an alkene (olefin), due to the presence of one carbon-carbon double bond in its structure. The double bond consists of one sigma (σ) bond and one pi (π) bond, which makes it more reactive compared to alkanes.",

      "question": "Explain how 1,3-butadiene is produced in the United States.",
      "answer": "1,3-Butadiene is a key chemical used in the production of synthetic rubber and other polymers. In the United States, it is primarily produced through the dehydrogenation of butane or butanol. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n### Production Process\n\n#### 1. **Butane Dehydrogenation**\n   - **Raw Material**: Butane, which is a byproduct of natural gas processing.\n   - **Process**: Butane is heated in the presence of a catalyst (typically a metal oxide such as vanadium pentoxide) at high temperatures (around 700°C to",
