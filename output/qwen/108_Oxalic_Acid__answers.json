      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows oxalic acid (H2C2O4). Key properties of oxalic acid include:\n\n1. **Chemical Composition**: Oxalic acid consists of two hydrogen atoms, two carbon atoms, and four oxygen atoms.\n2. **Structure**: It has a planar, symmetrical structure with two carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) attached to a central carbon atom.\n3. **Physical Properties**:\n   - **Appearance**: It appears as a white crystalline solid.\n   - **Solubility**: It is highly soluble in water.\n   - **Melting Point**: It",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula of oxalic acid and what type of compound is it?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for oxalic acid is \\( \\text{H}_2\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4 \\). It is an organic compound, specifically an oxoacid, which means it contains oxygen atoms in addition to hydrogen and carbon. Oxalic acid is also known as ethanedioic acid or ethanedioyl acid. It is a colorless crystalline solid that is highly soluble in water and has a strong acidic taste.",

      "question": "Describe the solubility properties of oxalic acid in different solvents.",
      "answer": "Oxalic acid, with the chemical formula H2C2O4, is a dibasic acid that exhibits distinct solubility behaviors in various solvents due to its acidic nature and molecular structure.\n\n### Solubility in Water:\n- **Soluble**: Oxalic acid dissolves readily in water. It forms a clear solution when dissolved.\n- **Solubility Limit**: The solubility of oxalic acid in water is relatively high, but it does not form a saturated solution at room temperature. This means that adding more oxalic acid to a solution will continue to dissolve until the solution becomes saturated.\n\n### Solubility",

      "question": "Explain how the synthesis of oxalic acid by Friedrich Wöhler contributed to the development of chemistry.",
      "answer": "Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of oxalic acid in 1828 is considered one of the most significant achievements in the history of chemistry, as it challenged the prevailing belief at the time that organic compounds could only be synthesized from other organic substances. This discovery was pivotal for several reasons:\n\n1. **Challenge to Vitalism**: At the time, the concept of vitalism was prevalent. Vitalism held that organic compounds could only be produced by living organisms and that they possessed some kind of \"vital force\" that made them unique. Wöhler's synthesis of oxalic acid, which is an organic compound, from",
