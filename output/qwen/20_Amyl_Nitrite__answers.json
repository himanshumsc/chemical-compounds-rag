      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Amyl Nitrite?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Amyl Nitrite is C₅H₁₁NO₂.\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight, we sum the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 5 = 60.05 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 11 = 11.088 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 1 = 14.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.0",

      "question": "Why is isoamyl nitrite considered unstable, and what are its effects when used medically?",
      "answer": "Isoamyl nitrite is considered unstable due to the fact that it decomposes into isobutanol and nitric oxide (NO) under certain conditions. This decomposition can occur spontaneously or be catalyzed by light, heat, or other chemical agents. The instability of isoamyl nitrite is important because it can lead to unpredictable reactions and potentially harmful outcomes if not handled properly.\n\nWhen used medically, isoamyl nitrite is primarily used as a treatment for angina pectoris, which is a type of chest pain that occurs due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It works by dilating the coronary arteries,",

      "question": "Describe the synthesis method of isoamyl nitrite, and explain its use in emergency medical situations.",
      "answer": "**Synthesis Method of Isoamyl Nitrite:**\n\nIsoamyl nitrite is synthesized by reacting amyl alcohol with nitric acid. The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Starting Materials:** Amyl alcohol (2-methyl-2-pentanol) and concentrated nitric acid.\n2. **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction typically occurs at room temperature or slightly above, under acidic conditions.\n3. **Mechanism:** The mechanism involves the addition of nitric acid to the amyl alcohol molecule, followed by the loss of water to form the nitrate ester.\n\nThe overall reaction can be represented as:\n\\[ \\text",
