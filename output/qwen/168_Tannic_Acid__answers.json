      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows tannic acid. Tannic acid is a complex organic compound with a high molecular weight, primarily composed of gallic acid units linked together by ester bonds. The diagram indicates that red atoms represent oxygen, black atoms represent carbon, and white atoms represent hydrogen.\n\nKey properties of tannic acid include:\n1. **Tanning Agent**: It is used in the process known as tanning to transform proteins in raw animal hides into forms that resist decomposition, converting the hides into leather.\n2. **Precipitation Property**: Tannic acid belongs to a class of compounds called tann",

      "question": "Explain the structural modification of glucose that leads to the formation of tannic acid.",
      "answer": "Tannic acid is not formed from glucose through a simple structural modification, but rather it is derived from gallic acid and other polyphenolic compounds. However, I can explain how glucose can be modified to form related compounds.\n\nGlucose, being a hexose sugar, has six carbon atoms and can undergo various modifications depending on the conditions and reagents used. One common modification involves oxidation reactions, which can lead to the formation of glucose derivatives such as glucuronic acid or glucose-1-phosphate.\n\n### Oxidation of Glucose\n\nGlucose can be oxidized at different positions to form various products:\n\n1. **Gl",
