      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of pyridoxine based on the provided information.",
      "answer": "Pyridoxine, also known as vitamin B6, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. Its solubility properties are influenced by its chemical structure and interactions with water.\n\n### Chemical Structure:\nPyridoxine has a pyridine ring attached to a hydroxyl group (OH) and an amino group (NH2). The presence of these functional groups allows for hydrogen bonding with water molecules, which enhances its solubility in aqueous solutions.\n\n### Solubility in Water:\n- **Water Solubility**: Pyridoxine is highly soluble in water due to the",
