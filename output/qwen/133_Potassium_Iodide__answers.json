      "question": "Explain how Potassium Iodide acts as a protective agent against radiation exposure.",
      "answer": "Potassium iodide (KI) is a compound that contains iodine, an essential nutrient for the thyroid gland. When taken orally before or during exposure to radioactive iodine, KI can act as a protective agent by saturating the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine. This process is known as \"iodine loading\" and helps to prevent the thyroid from taking up radioactive iodine, which could otherwise cause damage.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how potassium iodide works:\n\n1. **Thyroid Function**: The thyroid gland uses iodine to produce thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism in the body. These hormones are crucial",
