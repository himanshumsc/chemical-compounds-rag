      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Mercury(II) Sulfide?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Mercury(II) Sulfide is HgS.\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight, we need to sum the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n\n- The atomic weight of Mercury (Hg) is approximately 200.59 g/mol.\n- The atomic weight of Sulfur (S) is approximately 32.07 g/mol.\n\nSo, the molecular weight of Mercury(II) Sulfide (HgS) is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Molecular Weight} = (\\text{Atomic Weight of Hg}) + (\\text{Atomic Weight of",

      "question": "Describe the solubility characteristics of Mercury(II) Sulfide and its behavior upon heating.",
      "answer": "Mercury(II) sulfide, also known as mercuric sulfide or HgS, is an inorganic compound with a molecular weight of 200.61 g/mol. It is a black, brittle solid that is insoluble in water but soluble in dilute acids.\n\n### Solubility Characteristics:\n- **Solubility in Water:** Mercury(II) sulfide is insoluble in water. This means that it does not dissolve in water under normal conditions.\n- **Solubility in Dilute Acids:** In contrast to its insolubility in water, mercury(II) sulfide is",

      "question": "Explain the synthesis process of Mercury(II) Sulfide and how its different forms are produced.",
      "answer": "Mercury(II) sulfide, also known as mercuric sulfide or mercury(I) sulfide, is a chemical compound with the formula HgS. It can exist in several different forms due to its complex structure and the various ways it can be synthesized.\n\n### Synthesis Process\n\nThe most common method for synthesizing mercury(II) sulfide involves reacting mercury metal with sulfur gas (S₂). The reaction typically occurs at high temperatures, around 300°C to 400°C, under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon to prevent oxidation of the mercury:\n\n\\[ \\text{Hg",
