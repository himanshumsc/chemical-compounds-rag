      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows nitric acid (HNO₃). Nitric acid is a strong mineral acid with several key properties:\n\n1. **Chemical Composition**: It consists of one hydrogen atom (H), one nitrogen atom (N), and three oxygen atoms (O).\n\n2. **Structure**: The molecule has a central nitrogen atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, with one of these oxygen atoms also bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n\n3. **Properties**:\n   - **Strong Mineral Acid**: Nitric acid is highly acidic.\n   - **Corrosive**: It can corrode many metals and other materials.",

      "question": "Explain why nitric acid is considered a strong oxidizing agent and describe its reaction with metals.",
      "answer": "Nitric acid (HNO₃) is considered a strong oxidizing agent due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Electronegativity**: Nitric acid has a high electronegativity, meaning the nitrogen atom in HNO₃ can attract electrons strongly. This makes it capable of accepting electrons from other substances.\n\n2. **Oxidation State of Nitrogen**: In nitric acid, the nitrogen atom is in an oxidation state of +5. This high oxidation state makes it highly reactive and able to gain electrons or donate them to reduce itself.\n\n3. **Proton Donor**: Nitric acid is a strong",
