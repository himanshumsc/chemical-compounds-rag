      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows sodium silicate (Na2SiO3). The key properties of sodium silicate include:\n\n1. **Composition**: Sodium silicate consists of sodium ions (Na+), silicon atoms (Si), and oxygen atoms (O). Specifically, it has two sodium ions for every one silicon atom and three oxygen atoms.\n\n2. **Structure**: The silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms, forming a tetrahedral arrangement around the silicon. Each oxygen atom is also bonded to a sodium ion.\n\n3. **Double Bond**: The gray stick indicates a double bond between the silicon and one of the oxygen",

      "question": "Explain how the physical properties of sodium silicate vary and identify one key factor that influences these variations.",
      "answer": "Sodium silicate, also known as water glass or silicic acid, is a complex mixture of sodium silicates with varying degrees of polymerization. Its physical properties can be influenced by several factors, including the method of preparation, concentration, pH, and temperature.\n\n### Physical Properties of Sodium Silicate\n\n1. **Viscosity**: Sodium silicate solutions have high viscosity due to their high molecular weight and the presence of long-chain polymers. The viscosity increases with higher concentrations of silicate ions and decreases with increasing temperature.\n\n2. **Density**: The density of sodium silicate solutions is typically around 1.3 g/cm³",
