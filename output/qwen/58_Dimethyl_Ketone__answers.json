      "question": "Describe the solubility and state properties of Dimethyl Ketone.",
      "answer": "Dimethyl Ketone, also known as dimethyl formamide (DMF), is a polar organic solvent with several unique properties that make it useful in various applications.\n\n### Solubility:\n- **Soluble in Water:** DMF is highly soluble in water due to its polar nature. This makes it useful for dissolving many ionic compounds.\n- **Soluble in Organic Solvents:** DMF is also highly soluble in other organic solvents such as alcohols, ethers, ketones, esters, and aromatic hydrocarbons.\n- **Miscibility:** DMF can be mixed with most organic solvents without forming a",

      "question": "Explain the process by which Dimethyl Ketone is produced using the Hock process.",
      "answer": "The Hock process, also known as the Hock synthesis or the Hock rearrangement, is a chemical reaction used to produce dimethyl ketone (DMK) from acetaldehyde. The process involves a series of steps that convert acetaldehyde into DMK through a series of rearrangements and eliminations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Starting Material: Acetaldehyde**\n   - Acetaldehyde is the starting material for the Hock process. Its chemical formula is CH₃CHO.\n\n2. **First Rearrangement:**\n   - In the first step, acetaldehyde undergoes a",
