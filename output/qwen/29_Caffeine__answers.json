      "question": "Describe the physical state and solubility characteristics of caffeine based on the given information.",
      "answer": "Caffeine is a white, odorless, crystalline powder with a bitter taste. It has a melting point of approximately 235°C (455°F) and is highly soluble in water, alcohol, and many organic solvents.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its physical state and solubility characteristics:\n\n### Physical State:\n- **Appearance**: Caffeine appears as a white, crystalline powder.\n- **Melting Point**: It melts at around 235°C (455°F). This means that when heated to this temperature, it transitions from a solid to a liquid state without becoming a gas",

      "question": "Explain the significance of caffeine's melting and sublimation points and how these properties might affect its practical use.",
      "answer": "Caffeine, a widely consumed psychoactive substance, is known for its stimulant effects. Understanding its physical properties, such as its melting point and sublimation point, can provide insights into its behavior under different conditions and its practical applications.\n\n### Caffeine's Physical Properties\n\n1. **Melting Point**: The melting point of caffeine is approximately 230°C (446°F). This means that when caffeine is heated to this temperature, it transitions from a solid state to a liquid state without becoming a gas first. This property is significant because it indicates that caffeine will melt at high temperatures but will not sublime (",
