      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image does not contain a molecular structure diagram; instead, it provides information about cellulose xanthate, which is a chemical compound used in the production of rayon. Cellulose xanthate is derived from cellulose by treating it with carbon disulfide (CS₂). Its key properties include:\n\n1. **Solubility**: Cellulose xanthate is soluble in water and other solvents due to the presence of the xanthate group (-S=O), which makes it easier to process.\n2. **Reactivity**: It can be hydrolyzed back into cellulose under certain conditions, such as",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula for cellulose xanthate and which elements does it contain?",
      "answer": "Cellulose xanthate, also known as sodium xanthate or cellulose trioxime, is an intermediate in the production of viscose rayon. Its chemical formula is \\(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}_5\\text{N}\\).\n\nThe elements that make up cellulose xanthate are:\n\n- Carbon (C)\n- Hydrogen (H)\n- Oxygen (O)\n- Nitrogen (N)\n\nThese elements are present in the ratio of 6:10:5:1 respectively in the formula.",

      "question": "Explain how cellulose xanthate is transformed into rayon fibers during the viscose process.",
      "answer": "The viscose process, also known as the cuprammonium process, is a method used to transform cellulose xanthate into rayon fibers. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Cellulose Xanthate Preparation:**\n   - Cellulose is first treated with sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide to form cellulose sulfate.\n   - The cellulose sulfate is then treated with carbon disulfide (CS₂) in the presence of a catalyst such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to form cellulose xanthate.\n\n2. **Viscose Solution Formation",

      "question": "What are some advantages and disadvantages of using rayon, and what legislative measure was introduced in response to one of its disadvantages?",
      "answer": "Rayon is a synthetic fiber made from cellulose, which is derived from wood pulp or other plant materials. It is often used as a substitute for natural fibers like cotton and wool due to its durability and ease of care. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using rayon:\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Durability: Rayon is known for its strength and resilience, making it suitable for various applications.\n2. Comfort: Rayon fibers are soft and comfortable against the skin, making them ideal for clothing items that come into direct contact with the body.\n3. Moisture-wicking properties: Rayon fibers can absorb and release moisture,",
