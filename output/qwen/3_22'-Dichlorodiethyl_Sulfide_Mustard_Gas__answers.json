      "question": "Explain why 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide is referred to as 'mustard gas' despite being a liquid at room temperature.",
      "answer": "The term \"mustard gas\" refers to a group of chemical warfare agents that were used during World War I and later in various conflicts. The specific compound you mentioned, 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide (also known as mustard gas), gets its name from the distinctive odor it emits when exposed to air, which is often described as resembling the smell of mustard.\n\nThe reason for this naming convention is historical rather than scientific. During World War I, soldiers who were exposed to mustard gas reported a strong, pungent odor that was reminiscent of mustard. This odor, combined with the fact that mustard gas is",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility characteristics of 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide and its implications for its use as a chemical agent.",
      "answer": "2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl sulfide (also known as dichloroisopropyl sulfide or DICS) is a chemical compound that has been used in various applications due to its unique properties. However, it's important to note that this substance has also been classified as a chemical warfare agent by the United Nations and is regulated under international treaties.\n\n### Solubility Characteristics\n\nThe solubility of 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl sulfide in water is relatively low. It is slightly soluble in water at room temperature, which means that it dissolves only minimally in aqueous solutions. This",
