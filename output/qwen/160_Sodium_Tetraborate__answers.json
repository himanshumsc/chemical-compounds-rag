      "question": "Explain the historical significance and early uses of sodium tetraborate.",
      "answer": "Sodium tetraborate, also known as borax, is a compound with the chemical formula Na2B4O7·10H2O. It is a white crystalline powder that has been used for centuries in various applications due to its unique properties.\n\nHistorically, borax was first discovered in the ancient world. The Egyptians were among the earliest civilizations to use borax, which they obtained from natural deposits in the Dead Sea region. They used it in mummification processes and as a preservative for food. The Romans also recognized the value of borax and used it in glassmaking and as a flux in",

      "question": "Discuss the decomposition and melting characteristics of sodium tetraborate decahydrate compared to its anhydrous form.",
      "answer": "Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, also known as borax, is a hydrated salt with the chemical formula Na2B4O7·10H2O. It decomposes at high temperatures into its anhydrous form, sodium tetraborate (Na2B4O7), and water vapor. Understanding the decomposition and melting characteristics of both forms is crucial for various applications in chemistry and industry.\n\n### Decomposition Characteristics\n\n**Decomposition of Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate:**\n- **Temperature:** Sodium tetraborate decahydrate decomposes at around 350°C",
