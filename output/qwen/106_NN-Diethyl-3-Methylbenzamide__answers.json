      "question": "Explain the process by which N,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide (DEET) repels insects and discuss its safety considerations.",
      "answer": "N,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide, commonly known as DEET, is a widely used insect repellent. It has been in use since the 1950s and is considered one of the most effective insect repellents available. Here's an explanation of how it works and some safety considerations:\n\n### How DEET Works\n\n1. **Physical Barrier**: DEET forms a physical barrier on the skin that insects cannot penetrate. This barrier prevents the insects from landing or biting.\n\n2. **Behavioral Repellency**: DEET can also alter the behavior of certain insects. For example, mosquitoes, which",
