      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Magnesium Chloride?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Magnesium Chloride is \\( \\text{MgCl}_2 \\). \n\nTo calculate the molecular weight, we need to sum the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n\n- The atomic weight of Magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.31 g/mol.\n- The atomic weight of Chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\nSince there are two chlorine atoms in the formula, we multiply the atomic weight of chlorine by 2:\n\\[ 2 \\times 35.45 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 70",

      "question": "Explain the deliquescent property of Magnesium Chloride and its transformation into a hydrated form.",
      "answer": "Magnesium chloride, MgCl₂, is a deliquescent compound, which means it readily absorbs moisture from the air to form a hydrate. Deliquescent materials are characterized by their ability to absorb water vapor from the surrounding atmosphere until they reach a saturated solution or until they form a solid hydrate.\n\n### Properties of Magnesium Chloride\n\n1. **Deliquescent Nature**: Magnesium chloride is deliquescent because it can absorb moisture from the air until it reaches a saturated solution. This process is reversible; when exposed to dry air, it can lose the absorbed water.\n   \n2. **Hydrated Form**: When",

      "question": "Describe the industrial process used to produce magnesium metal from Magnesium Chloride.",
      "answer": "The production of magnesium metal from magnesium chloride primarily involves two main steps: electrolysis and reduction. Here's a detailed description of the process:\n\n### 1. Electrolysis of Magnesium Chloride Solution\n\n**Step 1: Preparation of Magnesium Chloride Solution**\n- **Magnesium Chloride (MgCl₂)** is dissolved in water to form a solution.\n- The concentration of MgCl₂ in the solution can vary, but typically, it is around 30% by weight.\n\n**Step 2: Electrolysis**\n- The solution is passed through an electrolytic cell where an electric current is applied across",
