      "question": "Explain why ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants instead of plain water.",
      "answer": "Ethylene glycol is commonly used as an antifreeze and coolant in automobile radiators for several important reasons:\n\n1. **Boiling Point Elevation**: Ethylene glycol has a higher boiling point than water, which means it can maintain its liquid state at higher temperatures without boiling off. This property is crucial for keeping the engine's temperature low during operation.\n\n2. **Freezing Point Depression**: Ethylene glycol also has a lower freezing point than water. When mixed with water, it effectively lowers the freezing point of the mixture, preventing the coolant from freezing even when the ambient temperature drops significantly. This is particularly important in cold",

      "question": "Describe the primary industrial method for producing ethylene glycol and discuss its efficiency.",
      "answer": "Ethylene glycol is primarily produced through the oxidation of ethylene, which is a byproduct of the petrochemical industry. The primary industrial method for producing ethylene glycol involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Ethylene Production**: Ethylene is produced from ethane or ethene (ethylene) through various processes such as cracking, reforming, or pyrolysis.\n\n2. **Oxidation of Ethylene**: Ethylene is then oxidized to form ethylene oxide (EO). This reaction is typically carried out in a catalytic reactor using a mixture of oxygen and ethylene at high temperatures and pressures. The",
