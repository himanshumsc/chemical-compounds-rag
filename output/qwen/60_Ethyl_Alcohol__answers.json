      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows ethyl alcohol (also known as ethanol). Ethyl alcohol is a chemical compound with the formula C₂H₅OH. Here are some of its key properties:\n\n1. **Chemical Structure**: \n   - It consists of two carbon atoms (black spheres), five hydrogen atoms (white spheres), and one oxygen atom (red sphere).\n   - The oxygen atom is bonded to one of the carbon atoms, which is then bonded to the other carbon atom.\n\n2. **Physical Properties**:\n   - **Color**: Colorless liquid.\n   - **Odor**: Characteristic smell.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of ethyl alcohol?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol, is \\( \\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} \\).\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of ethyl alcohol, we need to sum the atomic weights of each element in the molecule:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the molecular weight step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of carbon:\n   \\[\n   2",

      "question": "How is ethyl alcohol produced and what are the main methods used?",
      "answer": "Ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol or grain alcohol, is primarily produced through two main methods: fermentation of sugars and distillation.\n\n1. **Fermentation of Sugars**:\n   - **Process**: This method involves the conversion of sugars into ethyl alcohol using yeast in the presence of oxygen.\n   - **Ingredients**: The starting material can be any substance that contains sugar, such as fruits, grains, or molasses. Yeast is added to these substances to initiate the fermentation process.\n   - **Steps**:\n     - **Sugar Source**: The raw material (e.g., corn, sugarcane) is processed",
