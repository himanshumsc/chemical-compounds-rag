      "question": "How do BHA and BHT function as food preservatives?",
      "answer": "BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene) are both synthetic antioxidants used in the food industry to prevent fats and oils from becoming rancid due to oxidation. They work by scavenging free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that can cause damage to fats and oils.\n\n### Mechanism of Action:\n\n1. **Free Radical Scavenging:**\n   - Free radicals are unstable molecules that can react with other substances, including fats and oils.\n   - BHA and BHT act as antioxidants by donating electrons to these free radicals, thereby neutralizing",
