      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows Copper(II) oxide (CuO). The red atom represents oxygen, and the turquoise atom represents copper.\n\nKey properties of Copper(II) oxide include:\n- It is a red-colored solid.\n- It has a bluish to greenish tint when added to materials like glazes and artificial gems.\n- It acts as an insecticide and fumigant, primarily used in the treatment of potato plants and as an antifouling agent on boat hulls.\n- An antifouling agent prevents the formation of barnacles and other organisms on the bottom of a boat, reducing friction and thus increasing",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Copper(II) Oxide?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Copper(II) Oxide is CuO. \n\nTo calculate its molecular weight, we need to sum the atomic weights of the constituent elements:\n\n- The atomic weight of Copper (Cu) is approximately 63.546 g/mol.\n- The atomic weight of Oxygen (O) is approximately 15.999 g/mol.\n\nSo, the molecular weight of CuO is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Molecular Weight} = (\\text{Atomic Weight of Cu}) + (\\text{Atomic Weight of O}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Molecular Weight} = 63",

      "question": "Describe the solubility and natural occurrence of Copper(II) Oxide.",
      "answer": "Copper(II) oxide, also known as cupric oxide or basic copper carbonate, has the chemical formula CuO. It is a solid compound that is insoluble in water but soluble in acids.\n\n### Solubility:\n- **Water**: Copper(II) oxide is insoluble in water. This means that when you mix it with water, it does not dissolve and remains as a solid precipitate.\n- **Acids**: Copper(II) oxide dissolves in acids to form copper(II) salts. For example, when it reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl), it forms copper(II) chloride (",

      "question": "Explain the process of synthesizing Copper(II) Oxide from copper nitrate and its potential use in industry.",
      "answer": "Copper(II) oxide, also known as cupric oxide, is an important compound with various applications in industry. It can be synthesized from copper nitrate through a series of chemical reactions. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n### Materials Needed:\n- Copper Nitrate (Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O)\n- Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)\n- Distilled Water\n\n### Steps to Synthesize Copper(II) Oxide:\n\n1. **Preparation of Copper Nitrate Solution:**\n   - Dissolve copper nitrate in distilled water to prepare a solution. This solution will be",
