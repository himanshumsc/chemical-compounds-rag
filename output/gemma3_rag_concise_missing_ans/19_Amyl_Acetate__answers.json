Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.740)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually. The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

One\nmight think that water, sugar, and salt are the safest com-\npounds in the world. But, of course, one can drown in water,\nbecome seriously overweight by eating too much sugar, and\ndevelop heart problems by using too much salt. The risk\nposed by a chemical compound really depends on a number\nof factors, one of the most important of which is the amount\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nxvii\nReader’s Guide\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.635)]\nGlycerol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 349\nHexane. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 353\nHydrogen Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 357\nHydrogen Peroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 363\nIron(II) Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 367\nIron(III) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .371\nIsoamyl Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 377\nIsoprene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .381\nIsopropyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 387\nLactic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .391\nLactose. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 397\nL-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester. . . . 401\nLuminol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 407\nMagnesium Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 411\nMagnesium Hydroxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .415\nMagnesium Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .419\nMagnesium Silicate Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . 423\nMagnesium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 429\nMenthol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 435\nMercury(II) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 439\nMethane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443\nMethyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 449\nMethyl Mercaptan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 455\nMethyl-t-butyl Ether . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 459\nMonosodium Glutamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 465\nN,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide. . . . . . . . . . 469\nNaphthalene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 473\nNaproxen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 477\nNiacin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 483\nNicotine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 487\nNitric Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 493\nNitric Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 497\nNitrogen Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 503\nNitroglycerin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 507\nviii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.624)]\nacid. The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n",
