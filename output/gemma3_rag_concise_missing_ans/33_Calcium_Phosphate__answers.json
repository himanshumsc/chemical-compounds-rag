The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2).

Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water.

The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n",

In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.706)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.694)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nEthanoic acid;\nmethanecarboxylic\nacid; vinegar acid\nFORMULA:\nCH3COOH\nELEMENTS:\nCarbon, hydrogen,\noxygen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nCarboxylic acid\n(organic)\nSTATE:\nLiquid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n60.05 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n16.6\u0002C (61.9\u0002F)\nBOILING POINT:\n117.9\u0002C (244.2\u0002F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nSoluble in water,\nalcohol, ether,\nacetone, benzene,\nand other organic\nsolvents\nAcetic Acid\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAcetic acid (uh-SEE-tik AS-id) is a clear, colorless liquid\nwith a sharp odor. In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.691)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.
