          "text": "COMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVitamin E deficiency disorders are rare in humans. The\nvast majority of people get all the vitamin E they need in\ntheir daily diets. Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active. So synthetic\nvitamin E tends to be about\nhalf as active biologically as\nnatural vitamin E.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n39\nALPHA TOCOPHEROL\n",

Scientists believe that ibuprofen\nworks by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX),\nwhich converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Arachido-\nnic acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid that is used to\nbuild a number of important biochemical compounds, includ-\ning the prostaglandins. The prostaglandins are involved in\nthe transmission of pain impulses throughout the nervous\nsystem. If the COX enzyme is prevented from functioning,\narachidonic acid can not be converted into prostaglandins,\nand pain messages will not be transmitted.\nIbuprofen is especially effective in treating certain kinds\nof pain and inflammation, including those associated with\nmenstrual cramps, various kinds of arthritis, headaches and\nmigraines, pain from injuries and surgery, and discomfort\nassociated with influenza and gout.\nThe major risk associated with use of ibuprofen is sto-\nmach irritation. The inventors of ibuprofen had hoped to\nfind a substance that causes less stomach irritation than\naspirin. Ibuprofen does seem to cause fewer gastrointestinal\nproblems than does aspirin. Nevertheless, it can still cause\nsevere problems in some patients, especially those who take\nlarge doses. Common complaints from the use of ibuprofen\ninclude nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Patients who\nare especially sensitive or who take high doses of ibuprofen\nfor long periods may experience damage to the stomach\nlining.\nAs with any drug, some patients should avoid taking\nibuprofen entirely.
