As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide settles\nout of the reaction mixture as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipi-\ntate, which can then be dried and saved as a white powder. The\naluminum hydroxide can also be precipitated by passing\ncarbon dioxide gas through the solution.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAluminum hydroxide is an effective antacid because it is,\nchemically, a base. As such, it reacts with stomach acid\n(hydrochloric acid; HCl), to reduce the symptoms of heart-\nburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis, an\ninflammation of the stomach lining. The compound can also\nbe used to treat peptic ulcers on a long-term basis. A peptic\nulcer is an open sore in the lining of the stomach or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nAluminum hydroxide also has a number of industrial\napplications, such as:\n• A raw material for the preparation of other aluminum\ncompounds;\n• An additive for cosmetics, paper, plastics, and rubber to\ngive the final product more bulk;\nAluminum hydroxide. Red\natoms are oxygen; white atoms\nare hydrogen; and turquoise\natom is aluminum.
