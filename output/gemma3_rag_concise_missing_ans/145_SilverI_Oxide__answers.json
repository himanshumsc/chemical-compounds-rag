It is a white crystalline powder that occurs\nin nature as the mineral gibbsite, one of the three minerals\n(along with boehmite, diaspore) that makes up bauxite. Baux-\nite is a rocky material from which the metal aluminum is\nextracted commercially. Aluminum hydroxide is perhaps best\nknown to the average person as an ingredient in antacids,\ncompounds for the treatment of upset stomach, acid indiges-\ntion, and related symptoms. It is found in products such as\nMaalox\u0002, Mylanta\u0002, and Gelusil\u0002. A closely related chemical\ncompound, aluminum hydroxychloride (Al2Cl(OH)5) is the\nactive ingredient in most deodorants and anti-perspirants.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nMost aluminum hydroxide is produced by treating baux-\nite with a hot, concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide\nOH\nOH\nOH\nAl\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n45\n",
