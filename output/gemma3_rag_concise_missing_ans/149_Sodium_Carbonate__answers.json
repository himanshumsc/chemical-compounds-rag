          "text": "acetone. Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question. The For Further Information\nsection may also contain this information.\nInteresting Facts This section contains facts and tidbits\nof information about compounds that may not be essential to\na chemist, an inventor, or some other scientific specialist,\nbut may be of interest to the general reader.\nCommon Uses and Potential Hazards Chemical com-\npounds are often of greatest interest because of the way they\ncan be used in medicine, industry, or some other practical\napplication. This section lists the most important uses of\neach compound described in the book.\nAll chemical compounds pose some risk to humans. One\nmight think that water, sugar, and salt are the safest com-\npounds in the world. But, of course, one can drown in water,\nbecome seriously overweight by eating too much sugar, and\ndevelop heart problems by using too much salt. The risk\nposed by a chemical compound really depends on a number\nof factors, one of the most important of which is the amount\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nxvii\nReader’s Guide\n",

Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved.

In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH).

In that process, aluminum is\nextracted from one of its compounds (usually aluminum\noxide) by passing an electric current through the molten\n(melted) compound. The addition of aluminum fluoride to\nthe raw materials used in the process reduces the temperature\nat which the reaction occurs and improves the conductivity of\nthe molten compound.\nSome other uses of aluminum fluoride include:\n• As a catalyst in the synthesis of organic compounds;\n• To suppress the process of fermentation in the wine-\nand beer-making industries;\nAluminum fluoride.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.
