The last of these methods\nis commercially attractive because fluorosilicic acid is\nobtained inexpensively as a by-product in the production of\nfertilizers and phosphoric acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of aluminum fluoride is in the produc-\ntion of aluminum metal. In that process, aluminum is\nextracted from one of its compounds (usually aluminum\noxide) by passing an electric current through the molten\n(melted) compound. The addition of aluminum fluoride to\nthe raw materials used in the process reduces the temperature\nat which the reaction occurs and improves the conductivity of\nthe molten compound.\nSome other uses of aluminum fluoride include:\n• As a catalyst in the synthesis of organic compounds;\n• To suppress the process of fermentation in the wine-\nand beer-making industries;\nAluminum fluoride.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n",

The third method involves the addition of fluorosilicic\nacid (H2SiF6) to alumina trihdrate. The last of these methods\nis commercially attractive because fluorosilicic acid is\nobtained inexpensively as a by-product in the production of\nfertilizers and phosphoric acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of aluminum fluoride is in the produc-\ntion of aluminum metal. In that process, aluminum is\nextracted from one of its compounds (usually aluminum\noxide) by passing an electric current through the molten\n(melted) compound. The addition of aluminum fluoride to\nthe raw materials used in the process reduces the temperature\nat which the reaction occurs and improves the conductivity of\nthe molten compound.\nSome other uses of aluminum fluoride include:\n• As a catalyst in the synthesis of organic compounds;\n• To suppress the process of fermentation in the wine-\nand beer-making industries;\nAluminum fluoride.
