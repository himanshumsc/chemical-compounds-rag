The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid. Red atoms are\noxygen; black atoms are carbon;\nand white atoms are hydrogen.\nThe oxygen atom at top left\nshares a double bond with\nthe nearby carbon atom.\nP U B L I S H E R S R E S O U R C E G R O U P\n24\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.705)]\n• Amatol, a combination of TNT and ammonium nitrate,\nis often substituted for TNT in ordnance (weapons);\n• Minol, a variation of amatol that includes 20 percent\naluminum to increase its explosive power; and\n• Baratol, a mixture of TNT and barium nitrate that\nexplodes more slowly than pure TNT.\nIn addition to its primary use in explosives, 2,4,6-tri-\nnitrotoluene is also used to produce a very attractive yellow\ntint in the manufacture of dyes and photographic chemicals.\n2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is a hazardous chemical that can pro-\nduce both short- and long-term health effects, such as respira-\ntory problems, skin irritation, anemia, and lung damage. Some\nresearch shows the compound may be carcinogenic in labora-\ntory animals, but not in humans. Since most people are never\nexposed to TNT, these hazards are primarily of concern to men\nand women engaged in the manufacture or use of TNT.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nCooper, P.
