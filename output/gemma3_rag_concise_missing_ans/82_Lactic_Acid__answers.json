In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.680)]\nor\nto\now\nwords to know\n•\nA\nACETYL The organic group of acetic acid.\nADHESIVE A substance used to bond two surfaces together.\nALCHEMY An ancient field of study from which the modern\nscience of chemistry evolved.\nALKALI A chemical base that can combine with an acid to\nproduce a salt.\nALKALINE A substance that has a pH higher than 7.\nALKALOID An organic base that contains the element nitrogen.\nALKANE A typeof hydrocarbon that has no double bonds because\nit contains the maximum possible number of hydrogen\nALKENE A kind of hydrocarbon with at least one double bond\nbetween carbons.\nALKYL GROUP A chemical group containing hydrogen and\ncarbon atoms.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nxxxvii\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.680)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.
