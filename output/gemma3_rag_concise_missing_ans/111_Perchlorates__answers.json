The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n",

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations.

In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.754)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.731)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually. The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.
