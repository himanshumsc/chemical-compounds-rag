Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.739)]\nacetone.

Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question. The For Further Information\nsection may also contain this information.\nInteresting Facts This section contains facts and tidbits\nof information about compounds that may not be essential to\na chemist, an inventor, or some other scientific specialist,\nbut may be of interest to the general reader.\nCommon Uses and Potential Hazards Chemical com-\npounds are often of greatest interest because of the way they\ncan be used in medicine, industry, or some other practical\napplication. This section lists the most important uses of\neach compound described in the book.\nAll chemical compounds pose some risk to humans. One\nmight think that water, sugar, and salt are the safest com-\npounds in the world. But, of course, one can drown in water,\nbecome seriously overweight by eating too much sugar, and\ndevelop heart problems by using too much salt. The risk\nposed by a chemical compound really depends on a number\nof factors, one of the most important of which is the amount\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nxvii\nReader’s Guide\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.559)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nAlumina\nFORMULA:\nAl2O3\nELEMENTS:\nAluminum, oxygen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nMetallic oxide\nSTATE:\nSolid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n101.96 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n2072\u0002C (3762\u0002F)\nBOILING POINT:\n2980\u0002C (5396\u0002F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nInsoluble in water and\nmost organic sol-\nvents; slowly soluble\nin basic solutions.\nAluminum Oxide\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAluminum oxide (uh-LOO-min-um OK-side) is white crystal-\nline powder that occurs in nature in a variety of minerals,\nincluding boehmite, bayerite, corundum, diaspore, and gibb-\nsite. Corundum is second hardest naturally occurring mineral.\nOnly diamond is harder. Aluminum oxide occurs in a variety of\nchemical forms in a variety of gemstones, including chryso-\nberyl, ruby, sapphire, and spinel. The color of these gemstones\nis a result of impurities, such as chromium (in the case of ruby)\nand iron and titanium (in the case of sapphire). The colors may\nalso vary depending on the kind and amount of each impurity.\nAluminum oxide’s commercial uses depend not only on its\nhardness, but also on its high melting point and its low elec-\ntrical conductivity. The compound is also non-combustible and\nresistant to attack by most solvents and other chemical agents.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAluminum oxide is produced by washing the rocky mate-\nrial bauxite with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nAl\nAl\nO\nO\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n49\n"
