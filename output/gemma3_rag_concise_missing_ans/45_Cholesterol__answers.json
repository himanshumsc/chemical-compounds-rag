The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose.
