In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries.

The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n",

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.753)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.742)]\nGlycerol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 349\nHexane. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 353\nHydrogen Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 357\nHydrogen Peroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 363\nIron(II) Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 367\nIron(III) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .371\nIsoamyl Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 377\nIsoprene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .381\nIsopropyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 387\nLactic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .391\nLactose. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 397\nL-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester. . . . 401\nLuminol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 407\nMagnesium Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 411\nMagnesium Hydroxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .415\nMagnesium Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .419\nMagnesium Silicate Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . 423\nMagnesium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 429\nMenthol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 435\nMercury(II) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 439\nMethane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443\nMethyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 449\nMethyl Mercaptan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 455\nMethyl-t-butyl Ether . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 459\nMonosodium Glutamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 465\nN,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide. . . . . . . . . . 469\nNaphthalene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 473\nNaproxen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 477\nNiacin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 483\nNicotine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 487\nNitric Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 493\nNitric Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 497\nNitrogen Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 503\nNitroglycerin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 507\nviii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n"

Red atoms are\noxygen; black atoms are carbon;\nand white atoms are hydrogen.\nThe oxygen atom at top left\nshares a double bond with\nthe nearby carbon atom.\nP U B L I S H E R S R E S O U R C E G R O U P\n24\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.718)]\n(1848–1920) re-discovered and synthesized the compound in\n1873. Even then, the medicinal qualities of the compound\nwere not appreciated for another twenty years, and the com-\npound was not even prescribed or used by doctors until 1949.\nSince that time, however, it has become extremely popular,\nexceeded only by aspirin as the most popular analgesic sold\nin the world.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAcetaminophen is made in a straight-forward reaction\nbetween p-aminophenol [C6H4(OH)(NH2)] and acetic anhy-\ndride [(CH3CO)2O]. As its formula shows, the p-aminophenol\nprovides the basic structure from which acetaminophen is\nformed, with the acetic anhydride adding the -CH3CO group\nof atoms needed to complete the compound.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nIn addition to its use as a pain reliever, acetaminophen\nhas a number of industrial uses, including:\nAcetaminophen. Red atoms\nare oxygen; white atoms are\nhydrogen; black atoms are\ncarbon; and blue atom is\nnitrogen. Gray sticks indicate\ndouble bonds.
