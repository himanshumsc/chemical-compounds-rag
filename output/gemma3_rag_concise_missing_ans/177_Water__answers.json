The safest rule to\nfollow in dealing with chemical compounds is that they are\nALL dangerous under some circumstances. One should always\navoid spilling any chemical compound on the skin, inhaling\nits fumes, or swallowing any of the compound. If an accident\nof this kind occurs, one should seek professional medical\nadvice immediately. This book is not a substitute for prompt\nfirst aid properly applied.\nHaving said all that, some compounds do pose more\nserious health threats than others, and some individuals are\nat greater risks than others. Those special health risks are\nmentioned toward the end of the ‘‘Common Uses and Poten-\ntial Hazards’’ section of each entry.\nFor Further Information As the name suggests, this\nsection provides ideas for books, articles, and Internet\nsources that provide additional information on the chemical\ncompound listed.\nADDED FEATURES\nChemical Compounds contains several features to help\nanswer questions related to compounds, their properties,\nand their uses.\n• The book contains three appendixes: a list by formula,\nlist by element contained in compounds, and list by type\nof compound.\n• Each entry contains up to two illustrations to show the\nrelationship of the atoms in a compound to each other,\none a black and white structural formula, and one a\ncolor ball-and-stick model of a molecule or portion of a\nmolecule of the compound.\n• A chronology and timeline in each volume locates sig-\nnificant dates in the development of chemical com-\npounds with other historical events.\n• ‘‘For Further Information,’’ a list of useful books, periodi-\ncals, and websites, provides links to further learning\nopportunities.\n• The comprehensive index, which appears in each\nvolume, quickly points readers to compounds, people,\nand\nevents\nmentioned\nthroughout\nChemical\nCom-\npounds.\nReader’s Guide\nxviii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n"
