Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n",

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II.

Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.632)]\nIn addition to its use as a vitamin supplement for normal\nindividuals and those at risk for vitamin E deficiency, the\ntocopherols have a few other uses:\n• In the curing of meat to block the action of nitrosa-\nmines, a group of compound that occurs naturally in\nmeats and may be carcinogenic;\n• As an additive to animal feed to replace vitamins lost\nduring feed processing; and\n• As a food additive in vegetable oils and shortening to\nprevent oxidation (spoilage).\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nChallem, Jack, and Melissa Diane Smith.
