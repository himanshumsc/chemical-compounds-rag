          "text": "compounds, they usually use only the official IUPAC name\nfor a compound since that name leaves no doubt as to the\nsubstance about which they are talking. In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

          "text": "COMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVirtually all of the 1,3-butadiene produced is used in the\nmanufacture of polymers. Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid. Red atoms are\noxygen; black atoms are carbon;\nand white atoms are hydrogen.\nThe oxygen atom at top left\nshares a double bond with\nthe nearby carbon atom.\nP U B L I S H E R S R E S O U R C E G R O U P\n24\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.734)]\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVirtually all of the 1,3-butadiene produced is used in the\nmanufacture of polymers. Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.712)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.
