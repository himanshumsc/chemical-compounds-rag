(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n",

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.701)]\nOXIDIZE To combine a substance with oxygen, or to remove\nhydrogen from a molecule using oxygen, or to remove\nelectrons from a molecule.\n•\nP\nPARTICULATE MATTER Tiny particles of pollutants sus-\npended in the air.\nPETROCHEMICALS Chemical compounds that form in rocks,\nsuch as petroleum and coal.\nPH (POTENTIAL HYDROGEN) The acidity or alkalinity of a\nsubstance based on its concentration of hydrogen ions.\nPHOSPHATE A compound that is a salt of phosphoric acid,\nwhich consists of phosphorus, oxygen, sometimes hydro-\ngen, and another element or ion.\nPHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT The emission of electrons by a sub-\nstance, especially metal, when light falls on its surface.\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS The process by which green plants and\nsome other organisms using the energy in sunlight to\nconvert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and\noxygen.\nPHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT A type of photoelectric effect where\nlight is converted to electrical voltage by a substance.\nPLASTICIZER A substance added to plastics to make them\nstronger and more flexible.\nPOLYAMIDE A polymer, such as nylon, containing recurrent\namide groups linking segments of the polymer chain.\nPOLYMER A substance composed of very large molecules\nbuilt up by linking small molecules over and over again.\nPOLYSACCHARIDE A very large molecule made of many thou-\nsands of simple sugar molecules joined to each other in\nlong, complex chains.\nxlvi\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nWords to Know\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.699)]\nPRECIPITATE A solid material that settles out of a solution,\noften as the result of a chemical reaction.\nPRECURSOR A compound that gives rise to some other com-\npound in a series of reactions.\nPROPRIETARY Manufactured, sold, or known only by the\nowner of the item’s patent.\nPROSTAGLANDINS A group of potent hormone-like sub-\nstances that are produced in various tissues of the\nbody.
