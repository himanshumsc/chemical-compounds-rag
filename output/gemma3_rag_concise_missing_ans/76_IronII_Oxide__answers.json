It is one of a family of compounds, the\ntocopherols, that makes up vitamin E. Other members of the\nfamily include the beta (b), gamma (g), delta (d), and epsilon\n(E) tocopherols. All tocopherols share the same basic molecu-\nlar structure, differing only in slightly different arrange-\nments of methyl (CH3-) and hydroxyl (OH-) groups. In terms\nof biological activity, a-tocopherol is the most important\nmember of the tocopherol family. The tocopherols are all pale\nyellow, viscous oils found in a variety of plants, including\nalmonds, mustard greens, green and red peppers, spinach,\nand sunflower seeds. The most important source for the\nvitamin is wheat germ.\nVitamin E was discovered in 1922 by two scientists at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, Herbert McLean Evans\nC\nC\nC\nO\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nHO\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nH3C\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nHH\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n37\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.693)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nEthanoic acid;\nmethanecarboxylic\nacid; vinegar acid\nFORMULA:\nCH3COOH\nELEMENTS:\nCarbon, hydrogen,\noxygen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nCarboxylic acid\n(organic)\nSTATE:\nLiquid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n60.05 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n16.6\u0002C (61.9\u0002F)\nBOILING POINT:\n117.9\u0002C (244.2\u0002F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nSoluble in water,\nalcohol, ether,\nacetone, benzene,\nand other organic\nsolvents\nAcetic Acid\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAcetic acid (uh-SEE-tik AS-id) is a clear, colorless liquid\nwith a sharp odor.
