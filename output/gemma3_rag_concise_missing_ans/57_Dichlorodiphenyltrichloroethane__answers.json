The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate.
