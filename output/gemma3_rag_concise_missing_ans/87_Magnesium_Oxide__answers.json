Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.546)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nAlumina\nFORMULA:\nAl2O3\nELEMENTS:\nAluminum, oxygen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nMetallic oxide\nSTATE:\nSolid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n101.96 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n2072\u0002C (3762\u0002F)\nBOILING POINT:\n2980\u0002C (5396\u0002F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nInsoluble in water and\nmost organic sol-\nvents; slowly soluble\nin basic solutions.\nAluminum Oxide\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAluminum oxide (uh-LOO-min-um OK-side) is white crystal-\nline powder that occurs in nature in a variety of minerals,\nincluding boehmite, bayerite, corundum, diaspore, and gibb-\nsite. Corundum is second hardest naturally occurring mineral.\nOnly diamond is harder. Aluminum oxide occurs in a variety of\nchemical forms in a variety of gemstones, including chryso-\nberyl, ruby, sapphire, and spinel. The color of these gemstones\nis a result of impurities, such as chromium (in the case of ruby)\nand iron and titanium (in the case of sapphire). The colors may\nalso vary depending on the kind and amount of each impurity.\nAluminum oxide’s commercial uses depend not only on its\nhardness, but also on its high melting point and its low elec-\ntrical conductivity. The compound is also non-combustible and\nresistant to attack by most solvents and other chemical agents.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAluminum oxide is produced by washing the rocky mate-\nrial bauxite with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nAl\nAl\nO\nO\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n49\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.542)]\nPotassium Bitartrate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 629\nPotassium Carbonate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 633\nPotassium Chloride. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 639\nPotassium Fluoride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 643\nPotassium Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 647\nPotassium Iodide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .651\nPotassium Nitrate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 655\nPotassium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 659\nPropane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 663\nPropylene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 669\nPyridoxine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 673\nRetinol. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 677\nRiboflavin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 683\nSaccharin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 689\nSilicon Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 695\nSilver Iodide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .701\nSilver Nitrate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 705\nSilver(I) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 711\nSilver(I) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .715\nSodium Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .719\nSodium Bicarbonate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 723\nSodium Carbonate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 729\nSodium Chloride. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 735\nSodium Cyclamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .741\nSodium Fluoride. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 747\nSodium Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 753\nSodium Hypochlorite . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 759\nSodium Perborate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 765\nSodium Phosphate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 769\nSodium Polyacrylate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 773\nSodium Silicate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 779\nSodium Sulfite. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 785\nSodium Tetraborate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 789\nSodium Thiosulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 795\nx\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.524)]\n‘‘Aluminum Hydroxide Resources.’’ drugs@mongabay.com.\nhttp://names.mongabay.com/drugs/ingredients/\nALUMINUM_HYDROXIDE.html (accessed on September 18,\n2005).\nMalakoff, David. ‘‘Public Health: Aluminum Is Put on Trial as a\nVaccine Booster.’’ Science (May 26, 2000): 1323.\nSee Also Aluminum oxide\n48\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nALUMINUM HYDROXIDE\n",
