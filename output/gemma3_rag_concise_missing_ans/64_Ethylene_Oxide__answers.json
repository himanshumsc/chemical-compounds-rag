Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n",

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.678)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes. Most\npeople do not come into contact with the concentrated acid,\nand safety precautions are of importance only to individuals\nwho handle the material in their work.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetic Acid.’’ Chemical of the Week.\nhttp://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/AceticAcid/AceticAcid.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and CMA.’’ https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mcheryan/www/\ncma.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Acetic Acid and Derivatives.’’ Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Che\nmical Technology, 4th ed.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.
