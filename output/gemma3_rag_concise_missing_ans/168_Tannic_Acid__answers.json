In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.704)]\nacid. The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n"
