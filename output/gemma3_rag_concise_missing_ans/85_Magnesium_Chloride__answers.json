      "answer": "Magnesium Chloride (MgCl₂) is hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air. Specifically, it exhibits deliquescence – it absorbs so much moisture that it dissolves in the absorbed water, forming a solution. This process leads to its transformation into a hydrated form, often represented as MgCl₂·nH₂O (where 'n' is the number of water molecules). Source 2 lists Magnesium Chloride with a molecular weight of 411, Magnesium Hydroxide 415, Magnesium Oxide 419, Magnesium Silicate Hydroxide 423, & Magnesium Sulfate 429 – indicating its presence in the database, but not explicitly detailing deliquescence.",

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

It\nresists the action of even strong solvents, such as hot con-\ncentrated sulfuric acid. The compound often occurs as a\nhydrate containing one or more molecules of water of hydra-\ntion. The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially. In the first method, alumina\ntrihydrate (aluminum hydroxide; Al(OH)3) is treated with\nhydrofluoric acid (HF).
