      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly state why NaOH is deliquescent. However, it mentions NaOH is used to precipitate aluminum hydroxide. This implies a solution is involved, and deliquescence is a property of solids that absorb moisture from the air to form a liquid solution. NaOH's basic nature likely contributes to this hygroscopic behavior. The implication is that NaOH readily absorbs atmospheric water, which can affect its storage and handling.",

          "text": "acid. The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide settles\nout of the reaction mixture as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipi-\ntate, which can then be dried and saved as a white powder. The\naluminum hydroxide can also be precipitated by passing\ncarbon dioxide gas through the solution.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAluminum hydroxide is an effective antacid because it is,\nchemically, a base. As such, it reacts with stomach acid\n(hydrochloric acid; HCl), to reduce the symptoms of heart-\nburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis, an\ninflammation of the stomach lining. The compound can also\nbe used to treat peptic ulcers on a long-term basis. A peptic\nulcer is an open sore in the lining of the stomach or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nAluminum hydroxide also has a number of industrial\napplications, such as:\n• A raw material for the preparation of other aluminum\ncompounds;\n• An additive for cosmetics, paper, plastics, and rubber to\ngive the final product more bulk;\nAluminum hydroxide.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums.
