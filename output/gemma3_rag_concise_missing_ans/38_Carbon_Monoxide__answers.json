          "text": "COMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVirtually all of the 1,3-butadiene produced is used in the\nmanufacture of polymers. Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

          "text": "Researchers are constantly looking for new, more efficient,\nmore environmentally-friendly methods for making acetic acid.\nIn 2003, for example, chemists at the University of Southern\nCalifornia reported on a new method for making acetic acid\ndirectly from methane gas (CH4) using a catalyst of palladium\nandsulfuricacid.Otherresearchersarelookingforwaystooxidize\nthe waste gases produced from industrial processes to acetic acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAcetic acid is probably best known to most people as vine-\ngar. In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n",

In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.581)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.732)]\nFOSSIL FUEL A fuel, such as petroleum, natural gas, or coal,\nformed from the compression of plant and animal matter\nunderground millions of years ago.\nFREE RADICAL An atom or group of atoms with a single\nunpaired electron that can damage healthy cells in the\nbody.\n•\nG\nG/MOL Grams per mole: a measure of molar mass that indi-\ncates the amount of the compound that is found in a\nmole of the compound. The molecular weight (also known\nas relative molecular mass) is the same number as the\nmolar mass, but the g/mol unit is not used.\nGLOBAL WARMING The increase in the average global tem-\nperature.\nGLUCONEOGENESIS The production of glucose from non-\ncarbohydrate sources, such as proteins and fats.\nGLYCOGEN A carbohydrate that is stored in the liver and\nmuscles, which breaks down into glucose.\nGREENHOUSE EFFECT The increase of the average global\ntemperature due to the trapping of heat in the atmo-\nsphere.\n•\nH\nHARD WATER Water with a high mineral content that does\nnot lather easily.\nHELIX A spiral; a common shape for protein molecules.\nHORMONE A chemical that delivers messages from one cell\nor organ to another.\nHYDRATE A chemical compound formed when one or more\nmolecules of water is added physically to the molecule of\nsome other substance.\nxlii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nWords to Know\n"
