          "text": "For many years the way aspirin works in the body was not\nunderstood. Scientists now know that the compound’s helpful\neffects come from its action on prostaglandins. Prostaglandins\nare hormone-like substances released by cells that are injured.\nThey cause the body to release other substances that sensitize\nnerve endings to pain and start the healing process. Aspirin\nblocks prostaglandin production, thus relieving the sensation\nof pain and the inflammation that are the body’s response to\ninjury. Aspirin reduces fever by acting on the region of the\nbrain that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Prosta-\nglandins block the body’s natural system for producing heat\nso that by blocking the release of prostaglandins, aspirin\nallows the regulation of body temperature to continue as\nusual. Aspirin’s protection against heart attack and stroke\noccur because of its effect on one special type of prostaglan-\ndin, known as thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 promotes\nthe accumulation of cells that takes place when a blood clot\nforms. By blocking or slowing down the production of throm-\nboxane A2, aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots and,\nhence, the probability of heart attack and stroke.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe modern method for making aspirin was developed in\n1897 by the German chemist Felix Hoffman (1868–1946), an\nemployee of the German chemical manufacturer Bayer AG\nChemical Works. In this procedure, phenol (C6H5OH) is treated\nwith sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide to make salicylic\nInteresting Facts\n• The name aspirin comes\nfrom a very old name for\nsalicylic acid, spiraeic acid.\n• After Hofmann’s discov-\nery, Bayer received a\nregistered trademark for\nthe name aspirin, meaning\nthat no other company\ncould use the name for\nacetylsalicylic acid. When\nGermany was defeated in\nWorld War I (1914–1918),\nAllied forces seized the\nBayer company’s property\nand possessions and made\nthe name available to all\ndrug manufacturers.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n33\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n",

At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.519)]\n(1848–1920) re-discovered and synthesized the compound in\n1873. Even then, the medicinal qualities of the compound\nwere not appreciated for another twenty years, and the com-\npound was not even prescribed or used by doctors until 1949.\nSince that time, however, it has become extremely popular,\nexceeded only by aspirin as the most popular analgesic sold\nin the world.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAcetaminophen is made in a straight-forward reaction\nbetween p-aminophenol [C6H4(OH)(NH2)] and acetic anhy-\ndride [(CH3CO)2O]. As its formula shows, the p-aminophenol\nprovides the basic structure from which acetaminophen is\nformed, with the acetic anhydride adding the -CH3CO group\nof atoms needed to complete the compound.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nIn addition to its use as a pain reliever, acetaminophen\nhas a number of industrial uses, including:\nAcetaminophen. Red atoms\nare oxygen; white atoms are\nhydrogen; black atoms are\ncarbon; and blue atom is\nnitrogen. Gray sticks indicate\ndouble bonds.

Scientists now know that the compound’s helpful\neffects come from its action on prostaglandins. Prostaglandins\nare hormone-like substances released by cells that are injured.\nThey cause the body to release other substances that sensitize\nnerve endings to pain and start the healing process. Aspirin\nblocks prostaglandin production, thus relieving the sensation\nof pain and the inflammation that are the body’s response to\ninjury. Aspirin reduces fever by acting on the region of the\nbrain that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Prosta-\nglandins block the body’s natural system for producing heat\nso that by blocking the release of prostaglandins, aspirin\nallows the regulation of body temperature to continue as\nusual. Aspirin’s protection against heart attack and stroke\noccur because of its effect on one special type of prostaglan-\ndin, known as thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 promotes\nthe accumulation of cells that takes place when a blood clot\nforms. By blocking or slowing down the production of throm-\nboxane A2, aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots and,\nhence, the probability of heart attack and stroke.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe modern method for making aspirin was developed in\n1897 by the German chemist Felix Hoffman (1868–1946), an\nemployee of the German chemical manufacturer Bayer AG\nChemical Works. In this procedure, phenol (C6H5OH) is treated\nwith sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide to make salicylic\nInteresting Facts\n• The name aspirin comes\nfrom a very old name for\nsalicylic acid, spiraeic acid.\n• After Hofmann’s discov-\nery, Bayer received a\nregistered trademark for\nthe name aspirin, meaning\nthat no other company\ncould use the name for\nacetylsalicylic acid. When\nGermany was defeated in\nWorld War I (1914–1918),\nAllied forces seized the\nBayer company’s property\nand possessions and made\nthe name available to all\ndrug manufacturers.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n33\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.512)]\n• Amatol, a combination of TNT and ammonium nitrate,\nis often substituted for TNT in ordnance (weapons);\n• Minol, a variation of amatol that includes 20 percent\naluminum to increase its explosive power; and\n• Baratol, a mixture of TNT and barium nitrate that\nexplodes more slowly than pure TNT.\nIn addition to its primary use in explosives, 2,4,6-tri-\nnitrotoluene is also used to produce a very attractive yellow\ntint in the manufacture of dyes and photographic chemicals.\n2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is a hazardous chemical that can pro-\nduce both short- and long-term health effects, such as respira-\ntory problems, skin irritation, anemia, and lung damage. Some\nresearch shows the compound may be carcinogenic in labora-\ntory animals, but not in humans. Since most people are never\nexposed to TNT, these hazards are primarily of concern to men\nand women engaged in the manufacture or use of TNT.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nCooper, P.
