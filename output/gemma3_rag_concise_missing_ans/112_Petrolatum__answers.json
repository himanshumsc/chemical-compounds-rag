Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.770)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates. (The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.760)]\nHYDROCARBON A chemical compound consisting of only\ncarbon and hydrogen, such as fossil fuels.\nHYDROGENATION A chemical reaction of a substance with\nmolecular hydrogen, usually in the presence of a catalyst.\nHYDROLYSIS The process by which a compound reacts with\nwater to form two new compounds.\n•\nI\nINCOMPLETE COMBUSTION Combustion that occurs in such a\nway that fuel is not completely oxidized.\nINERT A substance that is chemically inactive.\nINORGANIC Relating to or obtained from nonliving things.\nION An atom or molecule with an electrical charge, either\npositive or negative.\nIONIC BOND A force that attracts and holds positive and\nnegative ions together.\nIONIC COMPOUND A compound that is composed of positive\nand negative ions, so that the total charge of the positive\nions is balanced by the total charge of the negative ions.\nISOMER Two or more forms of a chemical compound with the\nsame molecular formula, but different structural formu-\nlas and different chemical and physical properties.\nISOTOPE A form of an element with the usual number of\nprotons in the nucleus but more or less than the usual\nnumber of electrons.\n•\nK\nKREBS CYCLE A series of chemical reactions in the body that\nform part of the pathway by which cells break down\ncarbohydrates, fats, and proteins for energy.

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2.
