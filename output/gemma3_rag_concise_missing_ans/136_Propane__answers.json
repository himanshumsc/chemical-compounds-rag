Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question. The For Further Information\nsection may also contain this information.\nInteresting Facts This section contains facts and tidbits\nof information about compounds that may not be essential to\na chemist, an inventor, or some other scientific specialist,\nbut may be of interest to the general reader.\nCommon Uses and Potential Hazards Chemical com-\npounds are often of greatest interest because of the way they\ncan be used in medicine, industry, or some other practical\napplication. This section lists the most important uses of\neach compound described in the book.\nAll chemical compounds pose some risk to humans. One\nmight think that water, sugar, and salt are the safest com-\npounds in the world. But, of course, one can drown in water,\nbecome seriously overweight by eating too much sugar, and\ndevelop heart problems by using too much salt.

In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.539)]\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\n‘‘Acetylene Properties, Purity and Packaging.’’\nhttp://www.c f c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm\n(accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘The Environmental Impact of Acetylene Compared to Impact of\nPropane Chemtane 2.’’ Chemtane.\nhttp://www.chemtane2.com/environmental/cva_env_impact.\nhtml (accessed on September 16, 2005).\nO’Hara, Kelly. ‘‘Chemistry Hall of Fame 1997 Acetylene.’’ York\nUniversity.\nhttp://www.chem.yorku.ca/hall_of_fame/essays97/acetylene/\nacetylen.htm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\n‘‘Oxy acetylene Welding and Cutting.’’ ESAB.\nhttp://www.esabna.com/EUWeb/OXY_handbook/589oxy2_1.\nhtm (accessed on September 16, 2005).\nSee Also Polyvinyl chloride\nWords to Know\nOXIDATION A chemical reaction in which\noxygen reacts with some other substance\nor, alternatively, in which some substances\nloses electrons to another substance, the\noxidizing agent.\nSYNTHESIS A chemical reaction in which\nsome desired chemical product is made\nfrom simple beginning chemicals, or\nreactants.\n30\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.522)]\nIn addition to its use as a vitamin supplement for normal\nindividuals and those at risk for vitamin E deficiency, the\ntocopherols have a few other uses:\n• In the curing of meat to block the action of nitrosa-\nmines, a group of compound that occurs naturally in\nmeats and may be carcinogenic;\n• As an additive to animal feed to replace vitamins lost\nduring feed processing; and\n• As a food additive in vegetable oils and shortening to\nprevent oxidation (spoilage).\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nChallem, Jack, and Melissa Diane Smith.
