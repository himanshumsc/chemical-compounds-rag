The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

          "text": "COMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVirtually all of the 1,3-butadiene produced is used in the\nmanufacture of polymers. Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

          "text": "COMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVitamin E deficiency disorders are rare in humans. The\nvast majority of people get all the vitamin E they need in\ntheir daily diets. Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active. So synthetic\nvitamin E tends to be about\nhalf as active biologically as\nnatural vitamin E.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n39\nALPHA TOCOPHEROL\n",

The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.514)]\nAmmonium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 77\nAmoxicillin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 81\nAmyl Acetate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85\nAmyl Nitrite . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 89\nAscorbic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 93\nBenzene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 99\nBenzoic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 105\nBeta-Carotene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 109\nBoric Acid. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 115\nButane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 119\nButyl Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .125\nButyl Mercaptan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .129\nButylated Hydroxyanisole and Butylated\nHydroxytoluene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .133\nCaffeine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .137\nCalcium Carbonate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .143\nCalcium Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .147\nCalcium Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 151\nCalcium Phosphate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .155\nCalcium Silicate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 161\nCalcium Sulfate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .165\nCamphor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 171\nCarbon Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .177\nCarbon Monoxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .183\nCarbon Tetrachloride. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .189\nCellulose. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .195\nCellulose Nitrate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .201\nCellulose Xanthate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 207\nChloroform . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 211\nChlorophyll . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .217\nCholesterol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 223\nCinnamaldehyde. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 229\nCitric Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 233\nCollagen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 239\nContents\nvi\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.514)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually. The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

The\nvast majority of people get all the vitamin E they need in\ntheir daily diets. Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active. So synthetic\nvitamin E tends to be about\nhalf as active biologically as\nnatural vitamin E.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n39\nALPHA TOCOPHEROL\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.508)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.
