The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.708)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually.

In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.700)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.

The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially.

In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.667)]\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVirtually all of the 1,3-butadiene produced is used in the\nmanufacture of polymers. Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water.

That explosion, in turn, causes the\nless sensitive explosive, such as TNT, to blow up.\nTNT was discovered by the German chemist Joseph Wil-\nbrand (1811–1894) in 1863, although the compound was not\nrecognized as an explosive until almost thirty years later.\nThe compound was first produced commercially in Germany\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH3C\nNO2\nNO2\nNO2\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n15\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.640)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nBiethylene; bivinyl;\ndivinyl; erythrene;\nvinylethylene\nFORMULA:\nCH2=CHCH=CH2\nELEMENTS:\nCarbon, hydrogen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nAlkene (unsaturated\nhydrocarbon)\nSTATE:\nGas\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n54.09 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n\u0002108.91\u0003C\n(\u0002164.04\u0003F)\nBOILING POINT:\n\u00024.41\u0003C (\u000224.1\u0003F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nInsoluble in water;\nsoluble in alcohol,\nether, and benzene\n1,3-Butadiene\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\n1,3-butadiene (one-three-byoo-tah-DYE-een) is a colorless\ngas with a mild, slightly sweet odor. It occurs naturally in\npetroleum, from which it is extracted at refineries. The com-\npound was first discovered in petroleum in 1886 by the\nEnglish chemist Henry E. Armstrong (1848–1937) and his\ncolleague A. K. Miller (no dates available). This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance. Even then, Lebedev’s invention, called polybuta-\ndiene, was primarily a laboratory curiosity. There was rela-\ntively little demand for rubber products that could not be\nmet by the vast supplies of natural rubber from Southeast\nAsia.\nThat situation began to change in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe demand for rubber products in automobiles and other\nmotor vehicles, especially tires, grew rapidly as car and truck\nproduction increased rapidly year after year.

Scientists now know that the compound’s helpful\neffects come from its action on prostaglandins. Prostaglandins\nare hormone-like substances released by cells that are injured.\nThey cause the body to release other substances that sensitize\nnerve endings to pain and start the healing process. Aspirin\nblocks prostaglandin production, thus relieving the sensation\nof pain and the inflammation that are the body’s response to\ninjury. Aspirin reduces fever by acting on the region of the\nbrain that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Prosta-\nglandins block the body’s natural system for producing heat\nso that by blocking the release of prostaglandins, aspirin\nallows the regulation of body temperature to continue as\nusual. Aspirin’s protection against heart attack and stroke\noccur because of its effect on one special type of prostaglan-\ndin, known as thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 promotes\nthe accumulation of cells that takes place when a blood clot\nforms. By blocking or slowing down the production of throm-\nboxane A2, aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots and,\nhence, the probability of heart attack and stroke.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe modern method for making aspirin was developed in\n1897 by the German chemist Felix Hoffman (1868–1946), an\nemployee of the German chemical manufacturer Bayer AG\nChemical Works.

For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds. In a third type of struc-\ntural formula, the ball-and-stick formula, each element is\nReader’s Guide\nxiv\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.733)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.722)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death.

Corundum is second hardest naturally occurring mineral.\nOnly diamond is harder. Aluminum oxide occurs in a variety of\nchemical forms in a variety of gemstones, including chryso-\nberyl, ruby, sapphire, and spinel. The color of these gemstones\nis a result of impurities, such as chromium (in the case of ruby)\nand iron and titanium (in the case of sapphire). The colors may\nalso vary depending on the kind and amount of each impurity.\nAluminum oxide’s commercial uses depend not only on its\nhardness, but also on its high melting point and its low elec-\ntrical conductivity. The compound is also non-combustible and\nresistant to attack by most solvents and other chemical agents.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAluminum oxide is produced by washing the rocky mate-\nrial bauxite with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nAl\nAl\nO\nO\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n49\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.569)]\nPotassium Bitartrate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 629\nPotassium Carbonate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 633\nPotassium Chloride. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 639\nPotassium Fluoride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 643\nPotassium Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 647\nPotassium Iodide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .651\nPotassium Nitrate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 655\nPotassium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 659\nPropane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 663\nPropylene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 669\nPyridoxine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 673\nRetinol. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 677\nRiboflavin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 683\nSaccharin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 689\nSilicon Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 695\nSilver Iodide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .701\nSilver Nitrate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 705\nSilver(I) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 711\nSilver(I) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .715\nSodium Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .719\nSodium Bicarbonate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 723\nSodium Carbonate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 729\nSodium Chloride. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 735\nSodium Cyclamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .741\nSodium Fluoride. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 747\nSodium Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 753\nSodium Hypochlorite . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 759\nSodium Perborate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 765\nSodium Phosphate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 769\nSodium Polyacrylate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 773\nSodium Silicate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 779\nSodium Sulfite. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 785\nSodium Tetraborate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 789\nSodium Thiosulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 795\nx\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.555)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates.

The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.603)]\nResearchers are constantly looking for new, more efficient,\nmore environmentally-friendly methods for making acetic acid.\nIn 2003, for example, chemists at the University of Southern\nCalifornia reported on a new method for making acetic acid\ndirectly from methane gas (CH4) using a catalyst of palladium\nandsulfuricacid.Otherresearchersarelookingforwaystooxidize\nthe waste gases produced from industrial processes to acetic acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAcetic acid is probably best known to most people as vine-\ngar. In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa.

The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds. In a third type of struc-\ntural formula, the ball-and-stick formula, each element is\nReader’s Guide\nxiv\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n",

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.608)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes.

Corundum is second hardest naturally occurring mineral.\nOnly diamond is harder. Aluminum oxide occurs in a variety of\nchemical forms in a variety of gemstones, including chryso-\nberyl, ruby, sapphire, and spinel. The color of these gemstones\nis a result of impurities, such as chromium (in the case of ruby)\nand iron and titanium (in the case of sapphire). The colors may\nalso vary depending on the kind and amount of each impurity.\nAluminum oxide’s commercial uses depend not only on its\nhardness, but also on its high melting point and its low elec-\ntrical conductivity. The compound is also non-combustible and\nresistant to attack by most solvents and other chemical agents.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAluminum oxide is produced by washing the rocky mate-\nrial bauxite with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nAl\nAl\nO\nO\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n49\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.600)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans.

In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.679)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually.

That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds. In a third type of struc-\ntural formula, the ball-and-stick formula, each element is\nReader’s Guide\nxiv\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.630)]\nHYDROCARBON A chemical compound consisting of only\ncarbon and hydrogen, such as fossil fuels.\nHYDROGENATION A chemical reaction of a substance with\nmolecular hydrogen, usually in the presence of a catalyst.\nHYDROLYSIS The process by which a compound reacts with\nwater to form two new compounds.\n•\nI\nINCOMPLETE COMBUSTION Combustion that occurs in such a\nway that fuel is not completely oxidized.\nINERT A substance that is chemically inactive.\nINORGANIC Relating to or obtained from nonliving things.\nION An atom or molecule with an electrical charge, either\npositive or negative.\nIONIC BOND A force that attracts and holds positive and\nnegative ions together.\nIONIC COMPOUND A compound that is composed of positive\nand negative ions, so that the total charge of the positive\nions is balanced by the total charge of the negative ions.\nISOMER Two or more forms of a chemical compound with the\nsame molecular formula, but different structural formu-\nlas and different chemical and physical properties.\nISOTOPE A form of an element with the usual number of\nprotons in the nucleus but more or less than the usual\nnumber of electrons.\n•\nK\nKREBS CYCLE A series of chemical reactions in the body that\nform part of the pathway by which cells break down\ncarbohydrates, fats, and proteins for energy.

In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.699)]\nacetone. Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question. The For Further Information\nsection may also contain this information.\nInteresting Facts This section contains facts and tidbits\nof information about compounds that may not be essential to\na chemist, an inventor, or some other scientific specialist,\nbut may be of interest to the general reader.\nCommon Uses and Potential Hazards Chemical com-\npounds are often of greatest interest because of the way they\ncan be used in medicine, industry, or some other practical\napplication. This section lists the most important uses of\neach compound described in the book.\nAll chemical compounds pose some risk to humans. One\nmight think that water, sugar, and salt are the safest com-\npounds in the world. But, of course, one can drown in water,\nbecome seriously overweight by eating too much sugar, and\ndevelop heart problems by using too much salt.

The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency.

Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity.

In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.493)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually. The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.662)]\nIn addition to its use as a vitamin supplement for normal\nindividuals and those at risk for vitamin E deficiency, the\ntocopherols have a few other uses:\n• In the curing of meat to block the action of nitrosa-\nmines, a group of compound that occurs naturally in\nmeats and may be carcinogenic;\n• As an additive to animal feed to replace vitamins lost\nduring feed processing; and\n• As a food additive in vegetable oils and shortening to\nprevent oxidation (spoilage).\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nChallem, Jack, and Melissa Diane Smith.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n",

In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.594)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.718)]\nacid. The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n",

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

The third method involves the addition of fluorosilicic\nacid (H2SiF6) to alumina trihdrate. The last of these methods\nis commercially attractive because fluorosilicic acid is\nobtained inexpensively as a by-product in the production of\nfertilizers and phosphoric acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of aluminum fluoride is in the produc-\ntion of aluminum metal. In that process, aluminum is\nextracted from one of its compounds (usually aluminum\noxide) by passing an electric current through the molten\n(melted) compound. The addition of aluminum fluoride to\nthe raw materials used in the process reduces the temperature\nat which the reaction occurs and improves the conductivity of\nthe molten compound.\nSome other uses of aluminum fluoride include:\n• As a catalyst in the synthesis of organic compounds;\n• To suppress the process of fermentation in the wine-\nand beer-making industries;\nAluminum fluoride.

In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.708)]\nHYDROCARBON A chemical compound consisting of only\ncarbon and hydrogen, such as fossil fuels.\nHYDROGENATION A chemical reaction of a substance with\nmolecular hydrogen, usually in the presence of a catalyst.\nHYDROLYSIS The process by which a compound reacts with\nwater to form two new compounds.\n•\nI\nINCOMPLETE COMBUSTION Combustion that occurs in such a\nway that fuel is not completely oxidized.\nINERT A substance that is chemically inactive.\nINORGANIC Relating to or obtained from nonliving things.\nION An atom or molecule with an electrical charge, either\npositive or negative.\nIONIC BOND A force that attracts and holds positive and\nnegative ions together.\nIONIC COMPOUND A compound that is composed of positive\nand negative ions, so that the total charge of the positive\nions is balanced by the total charge of the negative ions.\nISOMER Two or more forms of a chemical compound with the\nsame molecular formula, but different structural formu-\nlas and different chemical and physical properties.\nISOTOPE A form of an element with the usual number of\nprotons in the nucleus but more or less than the usual\nnumber of electrons.\n•\nK\nKREBS CYCLE A series of chemical reactions in the body that\nform part of the pathway by which cells break down\ncarbohydrates, fats, and proteins for energy.

About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals.

The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.713)]\nchemical COMPOUNDS\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.713)]\ncompounds, they usually use only the official IUPAC name\nfor a compound since that name leaves no doubt as to the\nsubstance about which they are talking. In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds. In a third type of struc-\ntural formula, the ball-and-stick formula, each element is\nReader’s Guide\nxiv\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n",

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.703)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.634)]\nIn addition to its use as a vitamin supplement for normal\nindividuals and those at risk for vitamin E deficiency, the\ntocopherols have a few other uses:\n• In the curing of meat to block the action of nitrosa-\nmines, a group of compound that occurs naturally in\nmeats and may be carcinogenic;\n• As an additive to animal feed to replace vitamins lost\nduring feed processing; and\n• As a food additive in vegetable oils and shortening to\nprevent oxidation (spoilage).\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nChallem, Jack, and Melissa Diane Smith.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n",

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.646)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually. The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations.

Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals.

The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.747)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually.

It\nresists the action of even strong solvents, such as hot con-\ncentrated sulfuric acid. The compound often occurs as a\nhydrate containing one or more molecules of water of hydra-\ntion. The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially.

The\nvast majority of people get all the vitamin E they need in\ntheir daily diets. Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F).

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.700)]\n(1848–1920) re-discovered and synthesized the compound in\n1873.

The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]).

(They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.594)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.659)]\nResearchers are constantly looking for new, more efficient,\nmore environmentally-friendly methods for making acetic acid.\nIn 2003, for example, chemists at the University of Southern\nCalifornia reported on a new method for making acetic acid\ndirectly from methane gas (CH4) using a catalyst of palladium\nandsulfuricacid.Otherresearchersarelookingforwaystooxidize\nthe waste gases produced from industrial processes to acetic acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAcetic acid is probably best known to most people as vine-\ngar. In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]).

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.618)]\n(1848–1920) re-discovered and synthesized the compound in\n1873.

Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

Scientists now know that the compound’s helpful\neffects come from its action on prostaglandins. Prostaglandins\nare hormone-like substances released by cells that are injured.\nThey cause the body to release other substances that sensitize\nnerve endings to pain and start the healing process. Aspirin\nblocks prostaglandin production, thus relieving the sensation\nof pain and the inflammation that are the body’s response to\ninjury. Aspirin reduces fever by acting on the region of the\nbrain that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Prosta-\nglandins block the body’s natural system for producing heat\nso that by blocking the release of prostaglandins, aspirin\nallows the regulation of body temperature to continue as\nusual. Aspirin’s protection against heart attack and stroke\noccur because of its effect on one special type of prostaglan-\ndin, known as thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 promotes\nthe accumulation of cells that takes place when a blood clot\nforms. By blocking or slowing down the production of throm-\nboxane A2, aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots and,\nhence, the probability of heart attack and stroke.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe modern method for making aspirin was developed in\n1897 by the German chemist Felix Hoffman (1868–1946), an\nemployee of the German chemical manufacturer Bayer AG\nChemical Works. In this procedure, phenol (C6H5OH) is treated\nwith sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide to make salicylic\nInteresting Facts\n• The name aspirin comes\nfrom a very old name for\nsalicylic acid, spiraeic acid.\n• After Hofmann’s discov-\nery, Bayer received a\nregistered trademark for\nthe name aspirin, meaning\nthat no other company\ncould use the name for\nacetylsalicylic acid.

Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.740)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually. The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide settles\nout of the reaction mixture as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipi-\ntate, which can then be dried and saved as a white powder. The\naluminum hydroxide can also be precipitated by passing\ncarbon dioxide gas through the solution.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAluminum hydroxide is an effective antacid because it is,\nchemically, a base. As such, it reacts with stomach acid\n(hydrochloric acid; HCl), to reduce the symptoms of heart-\nburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis, an\ninflammation of the stomach lining. The compound can also\nbe used to treat peptic ulcers on a long-term basis. A peptic\nulcer is an open sore in the lining of the stomach or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nAluminum hydroxide also has a number of industrial\napplications, such as:\n• A raw material for the preparation of other aluminum\ncompounds;\n• An additive for cosmetics, paper, plastics, and rubber to\ngive the final product more bulk;\nAluminum hydroxide.

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry. Readers with a special interest in the synthesis\n(artificial production) of these compounds should consult\ntheir local librarian or a chemistry teacher at a local high\nschool or college for references that contain more informa-\ntion on the process in question.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.700)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates. (The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.694)]\n• Amatol, a combination of TNT and ammonium nitrate,\nis often substituted for TNT in ordnance (weapons);\n• Minol, a variation of amatol that includes 20 percent\naluminum to increase its explosive power; and\n• Baratol, a mixture of TNT and barium nitrate that\nexplodes more slowly than pure TNT.\nIn addition to its primary use in explosives, 2,4,6-tri-\nnitrotoluene is also used to produce a very attractive yellow\ntint in the manufacture of dyes and photographic chemicals.\n2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is a hazardous chemical that can pro-\nduce both short- and long-term health effects, such as respira-\ntory problems, skin irritation, anemia, and lung damage.

Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums.

The\nvast majority of people get all the vitamin E they need in\ntheir daily diets. Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active.

(They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time.

The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.724)]\nMore than 1.4 million metric tons (1.5 million short tons)\nof acetic acid are produced in the United States annually.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.716)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates. (The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n",

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.598)]\nhas been used in one other very different way: in the treat-\nment of cancer.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.514)]\n(1848–1920) re-discovered and synthesized the compound in\n1873. Even then, the medicinal qualities of the compound\nwere not appreciated for another twenty years, and the com-\npound was not even prescribed or used by doctors until 1949.\nSince that time, however, it has become extremely popular,\nexceeded only by aspirin as the most popular analgesic sold\nin the world.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAcetaminophen is made in a straight-forward reaction\nbetween p-aminophenol [C6H4(OH)(NH2)] and acetic anhy-\ndride [(CH3CO)2O]. As its formula shows, the p-aminophenol\nprovides the basic structure from which acetaminophen is\nformed, with the acetic anhydride adding the -CH3CO group\nof atoms needed to complete the compound.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nIn addition to its use as a pain reliever, acetaminophen\nhas a number of industrial uses, including:\nAcetaminophen.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n",

Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.666)]\nPRECIPITATE A solid material that settles out of a solution,\noften as the result of a chemical reaction.\nPRECURSOR A compound that gives rise to some other com-\npound in a series of reactions.\nPROPRIETARY Manufactured, sold, or known only by the\nowner of the item’s patent.\nPROSTAGLANDINS A group of potent hormone-like sub-\nstances that are produced in various tissues of the\nbody.

(They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

It is one of a family of compounds, the\ntocopherols, that makes up vitamin E. Other members of the\nfamily include the beta (b), gamma (g), delta (d), and epsilon\n(E) tocopherols. All tocopherols share the same basic molecu-\nlar structure, differing only in slightly different arrange-\nments of methyl (CH3-) and hydroxyl (OH-) groups. In terms\nof biological activity, a-tocopherol is the most important\nmember of the tocopherol family. The tocopherols are all pale\nyellow, viscous oils found in a variety of plants, including\nalmonds, mustard greens, green and red peppers, spinach,\nand sunflower seeds. The most important source for the\nvitamin is wheat germ.\nVitamin E was discovered in 1922 by two scientists at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, Herbert McLean Evans\nC\nC\nC\nO\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nHO\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nH3C\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nHH\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n37\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.613)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC",

It occurs naturally in\npetroleum, from which it is extracted at refineries. The com-\npound was first discovered in petroleum in 1886 by the\nEnglish chemist Henry E. Armstrong (1848–1937) and his\ncolleague A. K. Miller (no dates available). This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance. Even then, Lebedev’s invention, called polybuta-\ndiene, was primarily a laboratory curiosity. There was rela-\ntively little demand for rubber products that could not be\nmet by the vast supplies of natural rubber from Southeast\nAsia.\nThat situation began to change in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe demand for rubber products in automobiles and other\nmotor vehicles, especially tires, grew rapidly as car and truck\nproduction increased rapidly year after year.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations.

The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa.

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions.

It is one of a family of compounds, the\ntocopherols, that makes up vitamin E. Other members of the\nfamily include the beta (b), gamma (g), delta (d), and epsilon\n(E) tocopherols. All tocopherols share the same basic molecu-\nlar structure, differing only in slightly different arrange-\nments of methyl (CH3-) and hydroxyl (OH-) groups. In terms\nof biological activity, a-tocopherol is the most important\nmember of the tocopherol family. The tocopherols are all pale\nyellow, viscous oils found in a variety of plants, including\nalmonds, mustard greens, green and red peppers, spinach,\nand sunflower seeds.

It\nresists the action of even strong solvents, such as hot con-\ncentrated sulfuric acid. The compound often occurs as a\nhydrate containing one or more molecules of water of hydra-\ntion. The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially. In the first method, alumina\ntrihydrate (aluminum hydroxide; Al(OH)3) is treated with\nhydrofluoric acid (HF). A second method of preparation is\nalmost identical except that it takes place in the dry state\nF\nF\nF\nAl\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n41\n",

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.711)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

It\nresists the action of even strong solvents, such as hot con-\ncentrated sulfuric acid. The compound often occurs as a\nhydrate containing one or more molecules of water of hydra-\ntion. The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially. In the first method, alumina\ntrihydrate (aluminum hydroxide; Al(OH)3) is treated with\nhydrofluoric acid (HF). A second method of preparation is\nalmost identical except that it takes place in the dry state\nF\nF\nF\nAl\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n41\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.568)]\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVirtually all of the 1,3-butadiene produced is used in the\nmanufacture of polymers. Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n",

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.615)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries. Prolonged con-\ntact with the skin or eyes may, however, produce irritation of\ntissues and should be avoided. Concentrated forms of acetic\nacid pose more serious health risks, such as irritation of the\ngastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and eyes.

About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.615)]\nPRECIPITATE A solid material that settles out of a solution,\noften as the result of a chemical reaction.\nPRECURSOR A compound that gives rise to some other com-\npound in a series of reactions.\nPROPRIETARY Manufactured, sold, or known only by the\nowner of the item’s patent.\nPROSTAGLANDINS A group of potent hormone-like sub-\nstances that are produced in various tissues of the\nbody.

(They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.598)]\nResearchers are constantly looking for new, more efficient,\nmore environmentally-friendly methods for making acetic acid.\nIn 2003, for example, chemists at the University of Southern\nCalifornia reported on a new method for making acetic acid\ndirectly from methane gas (CH4) using a catalyst of palladium\nandsulfuricacid.Otherresearchersarelookingforwaystooxidize\nthe waste gases produced from industrial processes to acetic acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAcetic acid is probably best known to most people as vine-\ngar. In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]).

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.628)]\n(1848–1920) re-discovered and synthesized the compound in\n1873.

The last of these methods\nis commercially attractive because fluorosilicic acid is\nobtained inexpensively as a by-product in the production of\nfertilizers and phosphoric acid.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe primary use of aluminum fluoride is in the produc-\ntion of aluminum metal. In that process, aluminum is\nextracted from one of its compounds (usually aluminum\noxide) by passing an electric current through the molten\n(melted) compound. The addition of aluminum fluoride to\nthe raw materials used in the process reduces the temperature\nat which the reaction occurs and improves the conductivity of\nthe molten compound.\nSome other uses of aluminum fluoride include:\n• As a catalyst in the synthesis of organic compounds;\n• To suppress the process of fermentation in the wine-\nand beer-making industries;\nAluminum fluoride.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans.

In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.685)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.704)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates. (The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n",

The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.595)]\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nVirtually all of the 1,3-butadiene produced is used in the\nmanufacture of polymers.

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n",

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.604)]\nchemical COMPOUNDS\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.599)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.590)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death.

Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.692)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.684)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nAluminum trifluoride\nFORMULA:\nAlF3\nELEMENTS:\nAluminum, fluorine\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nInorganic salt\nSTATE:\nSolid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n83.98 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n1291\u0002C (2356\u0002F; begins\nto sublime above\n1250\u0002C [2280\u0002F])\nBOILING POINT:\nNot applicable\nSOLUBILITY:\nSlightly soluble in\ncold water, soluble in\nhot water; insoluble\nin alcohol, acetone,\nand most organic\nsolvents\nAluminum Fluoride\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAluminum fluoride (uh-LOO-min-um FLOR-ide) is a highly\nstable compound that occurs as a white crystalline solid.

The most common of these hydrates has the chemical\nformula AlF3\u00033.5H2O, meaning that for every two molecules\nof aluminum fluoride in a crystal, there are seven molecules\nof water. The major uses of aluminum fluoride are in a\nvariety of applications in the chemical industry.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThree methods are available for the preparation of alu-\nminum fluoride commercially.

The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.676)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC",

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Even then, the medicinal qualities of the compound\nwere not appreciated for another twenty years, and the com-\npound was not even prescribed or used by doctors until 1949.\nSince that time, however, it has become extremely popular,\nexceeded only by aspirin as the most popular analgesic sold\nin the world.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAcetaminophen is made in a straight-forward reaction\nbetween p-aminophenol [C6H4(OH)(NH2)] and acetic anhy-\ndride [(CH3CO)2O]. As its formula shows, the p-aminophenol\nprovides the basic structure from which acetaminophen is\nformed, with the acetic anhydride adding the -CH3CO group\nof atoms needed to complete the compound.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nIn addition to its use as a pain reliever, acetaminophen\nhas a number of industrial uses, including:\nAcetaminophen. Red atoms\nare oxygen; white atoms are\nhydrogen; black atoms are\ncarbon; and blue atom is\nnitrogen. Gray sticks indicate\ndouble bonds.

About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.701)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.699)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F).

Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.741)]\nGlycerol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 349\nHexane. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 353\nHydrogen Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 357\nHydrogen Peroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 363\nIron(II) Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 367\nIron(III) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .371\nIsoamyl Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 377\nIsoprene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .381\nIsopropyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 387\nLactic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .391\nLactose. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 397\nL-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester. . . . 401\nLuminol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 407\nMagnesium Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 411\nMagnesium Hydroxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .415\nMagnesium Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .419\nMagnesium Silicate Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . 423\nMagnesium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 429\nMenthol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 435\nMercury(II) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 439\nMethane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443\nMethyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 449\nMethyl Mercaptan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 455\nMethyl-t-butyl Ether . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 459\nMonosodium Glutamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 465\nN,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide. . . . . . . . . . 469\nNaphthalene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 473\nNaproxen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 477\nNiacin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 483\nNicotine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 487\nNitric Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 493\nNitric Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 497\nNitrogen Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 503\nNitroglycerin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 507\nviii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n",

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.744)]\n•\nC\nCARBOHYDRATES Organic compounds composed of carbon,\noxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as\nfood.\nCARBOXYL GROUPS Groups of atoms consisting of a carbon\natom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single\nbonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (–COOH).\nCARCINOGEN A substance that causes cancer in humans or\nother animals.\nCATALYST A material that increases the rate of a chemical\nreaction without undergoing any change in its own che-\nmical structure.\nCATHODE The electrode in a battery through which electrons\nenter the fuel cell.\nCATION A positively charged ion.\nCAUSTIC Capable of burning or eating away, usually by the\naction of chemical reactions.\nCENTRIFUGE A device that separates substances that have\ndifferent densities by using centrifugal force.\nCHELATE A chemical compound that is in the form of a ring.\nIt usually contains one metal ion attached to a minimum\nof two nonmetal ions by coordinate bonds.\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE Light produced by a chemical reac-\ntion.\nCHIRAL A molecule with different left-handed and right-\nhanded forms; not mirror symmetric.\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nA family of chemicals\nmade up of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.

In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]).

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.700)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.716)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nEthanoic acid;\nmethanecarboxylic\nacid; vinegar acid\nFORMULA:\nCH3COOH\nELEMENTS:\nCarbon, hydrogen,\noxygen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nCarboxylic acid\n(organic)\nSTATE:\nLiquid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n60.05 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n16.6\u0002C (61.9\u0002F)\nBOILING POINT:\n117.9\u0002C (244.2\u0002F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nSoluble in water,\nalcohol, ether,\nacetone, benzene,\nand other organic\nsolvents\nAcetic Acid\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAcetic acid (uh-SEE-tik AS-id) is a clear, colorless liquid\nwith a sharp odor.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 2 (Relevance: 0.678)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

In this form, it is used as a condiment and a food preserva-\ntive. The greatest volume of acetic acid is used, however, in a\nvariety of chemical processes, especially the manufacture of\nplastic materials such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and cellulose acetate. A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n",

Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.721)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.704)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates. (The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F).

About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.592)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]).

For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3).

In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds. In a third type of struc-\ntural formula, the ball-and-stick formula, each element is\nReader’s Guide\nxiv\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.647)]\n• For the production of a variety of organic compounds,\nsuch as those used in the manufacture of packaging\nmaterials, paints, adhesives and artificial fibers;\n• As a fumigant (pesticide) to preserve fruits and grains;\n• In the printing of textiles; and\n• As an acidifier to improve the flow of oil from wells.\nDilute acetic acid in the form of vinegar is harmless and\nhas been consumed by humans for centuries.

In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate.

The husband and wife medical team of E.B.\nand H.D. Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993. The United States\nstarting destroying its\nstockpile of mustard gas\neven earlier, in 1985, and is\nnow thought to have none\nof the chemical agent left.\n• Mustard gas was not used\nduring World War II. The\ncompound was, nonethe-\nless, responsible for the\ndeaths of more than 100\nU.S. men. On December 2,\n1943, a German attack on\nthe harbor of Bari, Italy,\nresulted in the sinking of\nabout two dozen ships.\nSome of those ships were\ncarrying mustard gas.\nWhen they sank, they\nreleased the gas into the\nsurrounding water, where\nsurvivors inhaled and\nswallowed the poisonous\ncompound.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n7\n2,20 DICHLORODIETHYL SULFIDE\n",

It occurs naturally in\npetroleum, from which it is extracted at refineries. The com-\npound was first discovered in petroleum in 1886 by the\nEnglish chemist Henry E. Armstrong (1848–1937) and his\ncolleague A. K. Miller (no dates available). This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance. Even then, Lebedev’s invention, called polybuta-\ndiene, was primarily a laboratory curiosity. There was rela-\ntively little demand for rubber products that could not be\nmet by the vast supplies of natural rubber from Southeast\nAsia.\nThat situation began to change in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe demand for rubber products in automobiles and other\nmotor vehicles, especially tires, grew rapidly as car and truck\nproduction increased rapidly year after year.

It occurs naturally in\npetroleum, from which it is extracted at refineries. The com-\npound was first discovered in petroleum in 1886 by the\nEnglish chemist Henry E. Armstrong (1848–1937) and his\ncolleague A. K. Miller (no dates available). This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance. Even then, Lebedev’s invention, called polybuta-\ndiene, was primarily a laboratory curiosity. There was rela-\ntively little demand for rubber products that could not be\nmet by the vast supplies of natural rubber from Southeast\nAsia.\nThat situation began to change in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe demand for rubber products in automobiles and other\nmotor vehicles, especially tires, grew rapidly as car and truck\nproduction increased rapidly year after year.

(The name vinyl refers to the remnant of an\nacetylene molecule after one hydrogen atom has been\nremoved: -CH2=CH-.) About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.551)]\nMONOSACCHARIDE A simple sugar, made up of three to nine\ncarbon atoms.\nMORDANT A substance used in dyeing and printing that\nreacts chemically with both a dye and the material being\ndyed to help hold the dye permanently to the material.\n•\nN\nNARCOTIC An addictive drug that relieves pain and causes\ndrowsiness.\nNEUROTRANSMITTER A chemical that relays signals along\nneurons.\nNEUTRALIZE To make a substance neutral that is neither\nacidic or alkaline.\nNITRATING AGENT A substance that turns other substances\ninto nitrates, which are compounds containing NO3.\nNSAID Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a drug that can\nstop pain and prevent inflammation and fever but that is\nnot a steroid and does not have the same side effects as\nsteroids.\n•\nO\nORGANIC Relating to or obtained from living things.

The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

Corundum is second hardest naturally occurring mineral.\nOnly diamond is harder. Aluminum oxide occurs in a variety of\nchemical forms in a variety of gemstones, including chryso-\nberyl, ruby, sapphire, and spinel. The color of these gemstones\nis a result of impurities, such as chromium (in the case of ruby)\nand iron and titanium (in the case of sapphire). The colors may\nalso vary depending on the kind and amount of each impurity.\nAluminum oxide’s commercial uses depend not only on its\nhardness, but also on its high melting point and its low elec-\ntrical conductivity. The compound is also non-combustible and\nresistant to attack by most solvents and other chemical agents.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nAluminum oxide is produced by washing the rocky mate-\nrial bauxite with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nAl\nAl\nO\nO\nO\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n49\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.524)]\ncompounds, they usually use only the official IUPAC name\nfor a compound since that name leaves no doubt as to the\nsubstance about which they are talking. In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Solubility is an important property because most\nchemical reactions occur only when the reactants (the sub-\nstances reacting with each other) are dissolved. The most\ncommon solvent for inorganic compounds is water. The most\ncommon solvents for organic compounds are the so-called\norganic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and\nbenzene. The solubility section in the entry for each com-\npound lists the solvents in which it will dissolve well (listed\nas ‘‘soluble’’), to a slight extent (‘‘slightly soluble’’), or not at\nall (‘‘insoluble’’).\nOverview: The overview provides a general introduc-\ntion to the compound, with a pronunciation of its name, a\nbrief history of its discovery and/or use, and other general\ninformation.\nHow It Is Made: This section explains how the compound\nis extracted from the earth or from natural materials and/or\nhow it is made synthetically (artificially). Some production\nmethods are difficult to describe because they include reac-\ntants (beginning compounds) with difficult chemical names\nnot familiar to most people with little or no background in\nchemistry.

It is one of a family of compounds, the\ntocopherols, that makes up vitamin E. Other members of the\nfamily include the beta (b), gamma (g), delta (d), and epsilon\n(E) tocopherols. All tocopherols share the same basic molecu-\nlar structure, differing only in slightly different arrange-\nments of methyl (CH3-) and hydroxyl (OH-) groups. In terms\nof biological activity, a-tocopherol is the most important\nmember of the tocopherol family. The tocopherols are all pale\nyellow, viscous oils found in a variety of plants, including\nalmonds, mustard greens, green and red peppers, spinach,\nand sunflower seeds. The most important source for the\nvitamin is wheat germ.\nVitamin E was discovered in 1922 by two scientists at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, Herbert McLean Evans\nC\nC\nC\nO\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nHO\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nC\nC\nC\nC\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nH3C\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nHH\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n37\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.661)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nSee Overview.\nFORMULA:\nAl(OH)3\nELEMENTS:\nAluminum, oxygen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nInorganic base\nSTATE:\nSolid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n78.00 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\nNot applicable; loses\nwater on heating to\nbecome aluminum\noxide (Al2O3)\nBOILING POINT:\nNot applicable\nSOLUBILITY:\nInsoluble in water;\nsoluble in strong\nacids and bases\nAluminum Hydroxide\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAluminum hydroxide (uh-LOO-min-um hi-DROK-side) is\nalso known as alumina hydrate, aluminum hydrate, aluminum\ntrihydrate, hydrated alumina, hydrated aluminum oxide, and\naluminum white.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.546)]\nOTHER NAMES:\nAlumina\nFORMULA:\nAl2O3\nELEMENTS:\nAluminum, oxygen\nCOMPOUND TYPE:\nMetallic oxide\nSTATE:\nSolid\nMOLECULAR WEIGHT:\n101.96 g/mol\nMELTING POINT:\n2072\u0002C (3762\u0002F)\nBOILING POINT:\n2980\u0002C (5396\u0002F)\nSOLUBILITY:\nInsoluble in water and\nmost organic sol-\nvents; slowly soluble\nin basic solutions.\nAluminum Oxide\nK E Y F A C T S\nOVERVIEW\nAluminum oxide (uh-LOO-min-um OK-side) is white crystal-\nline powder that occurs in nature in a variety of minerals,\nincluding boehmite, bayerite, corundum, diaspore, and gibb-\nsite.

The\nlargest fraction of that amount is used as a raw material in\nthe manufacture of plastics.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe most common method of making acetic acid is one\ndeveloped by the Monsanto chemical corporation. In this\nprocess, synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide [CO]\nand hydrogen [H2]) is heated over a catalyst of copper metal\nmixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (methyl alcohol;\nCH3OH). The methanol is then treated with carbon monoxide\n(CO) to make acetic acid. Acetic acid can also be made by the\nfermentation of any material that contains sugar or some\nother carbohydrate. Although this method is of interest from\na historical standpoint, it is not sufficiently efficient to use\nindustrially.\nAcetic acid.

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations. The average person is likely\nto have no contact with the compound.\nInteresting Facts\n• In 2004, U.S. manufac-\nturers produced 2.2 million\nmetric tons (2.4 million\nshort tons) of 1,3-buta-\ndiene, ranking it number\n22 among all chemicals\nproduced in the United\nStates.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n3\n1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.621)]\n‘‘Aluminum Hydroxide Resources.’’ drugs@mongabay.com.\nhttp://names.mongabay.com/drugs/ingredients/\nALUMINUM_HYDROXIDE.html (accessed on September 18,\n2005).\nMalakoff, David. ‘‘Public Health: Aluminum Is Put on Trial as a\nVaccine Booster.’’ Science (May 26, 2000): 1323.\nSee Also Aluminum oxide\n48\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nALUMINUM HYDROXIDE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.621)]\nPRECIPITATE A solid material that settles out of a solution,\noften as the result of a chemical reaction.\nPRECURSOR A compound that gives rise to some other com-\npound in a series of reactions.\nPROPRIETARY Manufactured, sold, or known only by the\nowner of the item’s patent.\nPROSTAGLANDINS A group of potent hormone-like sub-\nstances that are produced in various tissues of the\nbody.

Krumbhaar discovered in 1919 that mustard gas was\neffective in treating cancer in experimental animals. (They\ncalled the compound by its then-popular name, yellow cross\ngas.) The compound was one of the first chemicals to be used\nin the treatment of cancer. Researchers continued to study\nthe cancer-fighting properties of mustard gas for more than\ntwenty years, but the compound has never been widely used\nfor that purpose.\nThe effects of exposure to mustard gas vary over time. At\nfirst, a person who has inhaled the gas may become nau-\nseated, experience itchy and sore eyes, and begin vomiting.\nHis or her skin turns red and blisters may develop. Exposure\nto large amounts of the gas may result in permanent damage\nto the eyes and respiratory system resulting, in the worst\ncases, in coma and death. People exposed to mustard gas who\nsurvive may later develop mouth, lung, or stomach cancer.\nInteresting Facts\n• Another name for mustard\ngas, yprite, comes from\nthe Belgian city Ypres\n(pronounced ‘‘EE-pr’’’),\nwhere the compound was\nfirst use as a military\nweapon.\n• The use of mustard gas\nwas outlawed by the\nChemical Weapons\nConvention, adopted in\n1993.

A more recent use of\nacetic acid is in the manufacture of calcium magnesium acetate\n(CMA), a deicer. Traditionally, roads, highways, and airport\nrunways have been treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or\nsome other salt to remove snow and ice. These compounds have\nserious environmental effects, however, and researchers have\nlong been looking for alternatives that are as effective in\nremoving snow and ice, but less harmful to the environment.\nCMA has been the most promising of these alternatives, and its\nproduction has produced a growing demand for acetic acid.\nSome other applications of acetic acid include:\n• As a cleaning agent;\n• In the manufacture of photographic materials;\nInteresting Facts\nAncient Romans boiled\nfermented wine (vinegar) in\nlead pots to make a sweet\nsyrup called sapa. The acetic\nacid in the vinegar dissolved a\nsmall amount of lead from\nwhich the pots were made,\nproducing lead acetate\n(Pb[C2H3O2]). When they used\nsapa as a sweetening agent\nin their foods, the Romans\ningested the lead acetate\nwhich, over long periods of\ntime, caused the lead poison\ning from which so many of\nthem died.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n25\nACETIC ACID\n",

It occurs\nas a colorless gas with a sweet odor when pure, but an\nunpleasant odor due to the presence of phosphine (PH3)\nand/or arsine (AsH3), with which it is often contaminated.\nAcetylene is a highly flammable gas that is also somewhat\nexplosive. This property accounts for one of its most impor-\ntant uses, in torches that burn at very high temperatures.\nAcetylene\nwas\ndiscovered\nby\nthe\nBritish\nchemist\nEdmund Davy (1785–1857) in 1836. Davy obtained the gas\naccidentally when he combined water with potassium carbide\n(KCH2) while attempting to make potassium metal. He noted\nthat the gas burned with a bright flame and thought it\nmight be used as a source of illumination.

It occurs naturally in\npetroleum, from which it is extracted at refineries. The com-\npound was first discovered in petroleum in 1886 by the\nEnglish chemist Henry E. Armstrong (1848–1937) and his\ncolleague A. K. Miller (no dates available). This discovery\napparently had no practical application until 1910 when the\nRussian chemist Sergei Lebedev (1874–1934) developed a\nmethod for polymerizing butadiene to make a rubber-like\nsubstance.

Its major use is in the manufacture\nof explosives. It may be used alone or in combination with\nother explosive chemicals. Although not as powerful as some\nother explosives, it has the advantage of being relatively\ninsensitive to shock. Workers can handle the explosive with-\nout fear that it will suddenly explode if dropped or jarred. In\nfact, a blasting cap or detonator is needed to cause TNT to\nexplode. Blasting caps and detonators are very sensitive\nexplosives that can be attached to less sensitive explosives\nlike TNT. Any small shock to the blasting cap or detonator\nwill cause it to explode. That explosion, in turn, causes the\nless sensitive explosive, such as TNT, to blow up.\nTNT was discovered by the German chemist Joseph Wil-\nbrand (1811–1894) in 1863, although the compound was not\nrecognized as an explosive until almost thirty years later.\nThe compound was first produced commercially in Germany\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH3C\nNO2\nNO2\nNO2\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n15\n",

Polybutadiene itself is too soft for\nmost industrial rubber uses. So it is sometimes mixed with\nother polymers to make products with a variety of desirable\nqualities. Or it is polymerized with other monomers to make\nspecialized copolymers. One of the most popular of the mixed\npolymers is polystyrene-polybutadiene. The second polymer\nin this mixture, polystyrene, is a polymer of the compound\nstyrene (C6H5CH=CH2). Some other uses of 1,3-butadiene\ninclude:\n• Raw material in the manufacture of fungicides such as\nCaptan and Captofol;\n• Manufacture of latex adhesives;\n• Production of domestic products, such as the backing\non nylon carpet, appliance and electrical equipment,\nand luggage;\n• Manufacture of industrial products, such as piping and\nconduits.\n1,3-butadiene has a variety of harmful effects on humans,\nincluding irritation of the respiratory system, fatigue, drow-\nsiness, headache, vertigo, loss of consciousness, respiratory\nparalysis, and death. The compound is also thought to be a\ncarcinogen. Only people who work directly with the com-\npound, however, are likely to experience such effects, and\nonly then in unusual situations.

In its pure form, the compound is also\nknown as glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the primary active\ningredient of vinegar, which typically consists of about five\nparts of acetic acid mixed with 95 parts of water. The com-\npound’s name comes from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.\nAcetic acid, in the form of vinegar, has been known to\nhumans for centuries. When fruit juices are allowed to stand\nfor too long, or when they are fermented to make wine,\nvinegar forms. The use of vinegar as a condiment is men-\ntioned a number of times in the Bible, and was described by\nthe Greek natural philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372–c. 287 BCE).\nThe first person to extract acetic acid from vinegar was\nthe Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber (c. 721–815).\nThe pure compound was not produced, however, for another\nten centuries when the German chemist Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660–1734) extracted acetic acid from vinegar in 1700 by\ndistillation.\nC\nOH\nO\nCH3\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n23\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.769)]\nand perchloroethylene, and the family of plastics known as\nthe acrylates.

About 20 percent of all the acetylene\nproduced is used for torches that produce very hot flames.\nIn one such torch, the oxyacetylene torch, acetylene gas\nand oxygen are mixed and ignited at the tip of the torch.\nThe combination of gases burns at a temperature of 3,000\u0003C\nto 3,500\u0003C (5,500\u0003F to 6,300\u0003F). Oxyacetylene torches are\nused to cut through metal and to weld two metals to each\nother. They can be used in very cold climates and even under\nwater.\nAcetylene is both very flammable and explosive. Any-\none who works with the compound or uses it in any form\nshould know how to use the device that contains the gas.\nAcetylene also has the somewhat unusual chemical property\nof reacting with certain metals, such as copper and silver, to\nform highly explosive compounds known as acetylides.\nLamps, torches, and other devices built to hold and dispense\nacetylene can not contain any of these metals. High concen-\ntrations of the gas also pose a health hazard to humans. It\nis classified as an asphyxiant, a gas that can produce dis-\norientation, unconsciousness, and death when inhaled to\nexcess.\nInteresting Facts\nAcetylene was used as\na source of illumination\nbeginning in the early\n1900s. In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.708)]\ncompounds, they usually use only the official IUPAC name\nfor a compound since that name leaves no doubt as to the\nsubstance about which they are talking. In some cases, a\ncompound may have more than one official name, depending\non the set of rules used in the naming process. For example,\n1,10-thiobis[2-chloroethane] is also an acceptable name for\nmustard gas. The ‘‘Other Names’’ section of each entry\nlists both the systematic (IUPAC) and common names for a\ncompound.\nMany compounds also have another kind of name, a\nbrand name or trade name given to them by their manufac-\nturers. For example, some trade names for the pain killer\nacetaminophen are PanadolTM, TylenolTM, AcetaTM, Gena-\npapTM, TempraTM, and DepacinTM. The symbol next to each\nname means that the name is registered to the company that\nmakes the compound. Trades names may be mentioned in the\nOverview or Uses sections of the entry for each compound.\nChemical Formula: A chemical formula is a set of sym-\nbols that tells the elements present in a compound and the\nrelative numbers of each element. For example, the chemical\nformula for the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. That for-\nmula tells that for every one carbon atom (C) in carbon\ndioxide there are two atoms of oxygen (O).\nChemists use different kinds of formulas to describe a\ncompound. The simplest formula is a molecular formula.\nA molecular formula like CO2 tells the kind and relative\nnumber of elements present in the compound. Another kind\nof formula is a structural formula. A structural formula\nprovides one additional piece of information: The arrange-\nment of elements in a compound. The structural formula for\nmethanol (wood alcohol), for example, is CH3OH. That for-\nmula shows that methanol consists of a carbon atom (C) to\nwhich are attached three hydrogen (H) atoms (CH3). The\ncarbon atom is also joined to an oxygen atom (O) which, in\nturn, is attached to a hydrogen atom (H).\nStructural formulas can be written in a variety of ways.\nAnother way to draw the structural formula for methanol, for\nexample, is to show where individual bonds between atoms\nbranch off other atoms in different directions. These struc-\ntural formulas can be seen on the first page of nearly\nall entries in Chemical Compounds.

As the solution cools, aluminum hydroxide settles\nout of the reaction mixture as a gelatinous (jelly-like) precipi-\ntate, which can then be dried and saved as a white powder. The\naluminum hydroxide can also be precipitated by passing\ncarbon dioxide gas through the solution.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nAluminum hydroxide is an effective antacid because it is,\nchemically, a base. As such, it reacts with stomach acid\n(hydrochloric acid; HCl), to reduce the symptoms of heart-\nburn, upset stomach, acid indigestion, and gastritis, an\ninflammation of the stomach lining. The compound can also\nbe used to treat peptic ulcers on a long-term basis. A peptic\nulcer is an open sore in the lining of the stomach or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nAluminum hydroxide also has a number of industrial\napplications, such as:\n• A raw material for the preparation of other aluminum\ncompounds;\n• An additive for cosmetics, paper, plastics, and rubber to\ngive the final product more bulk;\nAluminum hydroxide.

The salicylic acid is then reacted with acetic acid\n(CH3COOH) to make acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. The prepara-\ntion of aspirin by this procedure is quite simple and is often\nassigned to students in beginning high school and college chem-\nistry classes. Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death.

In one type of\nacetylene lamp, water was\nallowed to drop on a solid\nchunk of calcium carbide at a\ncontrolled rate. The acetylene\nproduced then passed into an\nignition chamber, where it\nburned with a brilliant white\nlight. Acetylene lamps were\nused in a variety of settings,\nsuch as the source of light\nfor bicycles and early motor\ncars and as a source of\nillumination for miners.\nSome small towns even used\nacetylene lamps as their\nmajor source of town lighting.\nAcetylene lamps continue to\nbe a popular collectors item\namong antique dealers today.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n29\nACETYLENE\n\n\n[Source 4 (Relevance: 0.738)]\nGlycerol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 349\nHexane. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 353\nHydrogen Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 357\nHydrogen Peroxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 363\nIron(II) Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 367\nIron(III) Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .371\nIsoamyl Acetate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 377\nIsoprene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .381\nIsopropyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 387\nLactic Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .391\nLactose. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 397\nL-Aspartyl-L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester. . . . 401\nLuminol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 407\nMagnesium Chloride . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 411\nMagnesium Hydroxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .415\nMagnesium Oxide. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .419\nMagnesium Silicate Hydroxide . . . . . . . . . . 423\nMagnesium Sulfate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 429\nMenthol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 435\nMercury(II) Sulfide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 439\nMethane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443\nMethyl Alcohol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 449\nMethyl Mercaptan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 455\nMethyl-t-butyl Ether . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 459\nMonosodium Glutamate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 465\nN,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide. . . . . . . . . . 469\nNaphthalene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 473\nNaproxen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 477\nNiacin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 483\nNicotine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 487\nNitric Acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 493\nNitric Oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 497\nNitrogen Dioxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 503\nNitroglycerin. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 507\nviii\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\nContents\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.737)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC",

Scientists believe that ibuprofen\nworks by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX),\nwhich converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Arachido-\nnic acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid that is used to\nbuild a number of important biochemical compounds, includ-\ning the prostaglandins. The prostaglandins are involved in\nthe transmission of pain impulses throughout the nervous\nsystem. If the COX enzyme is prevented from functioning,\narachidonic acid can not be converted into prostaglandins,\nand pain messages will not be transmitted.\nIbuprofen is especially effective in treating certain kinds\nof pain and inflammation, including those associated with\nmenstrual cramps, various kinds of arthritis, headaches and\nmigraines, pain from injuries and surgery, and discomfort\nassociated with influenza and gout.\nThe major risk associated with use of ibuprofen is sto-\nmach irritation. The inventors of ibuprofen had hoped to\nfind a substance that causes less stomach irritation than\naspirin. Ibuprofen does seem to cause fewer gastrointestinal\nproblems than does aspirin. Nevertheless, it can still cause\nsevere problems in some patients, especially those who take\nlarge doses. Common complaints from the use of ibuprofen\ninclude nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Patients who\nare especially sensitive or who take high doses of ibuprofen\nfor long periods may experience damage to the stomach\nlining.\nAs with any drug, some patients should avoid taking\nibuprofen entirely.

The\nvast majority of people get all the vitamin E they need in\ntheir daily diets. Three groups of people may, however,\nrequire vitamin E supplements. The first group consists of\nindividuals who are unable to absorb fat in their diets, so\nthat the vitamin E they ingest is immediately eliminated\nfrom their bodies. The second group consists of a small\nfraction of people who have genetic disorders that make it\nimpossible for them to utilize a-tocopherol. The third group\nof individuals consist of premature and very young babies.\nAll babies are born deficient in vitamin E, but they normally\novercome that deficiency in the first few weeks of their lives.\nPremature babies and some babies born at term may experi-\nence a variety of health problems as a result of vitamin E\ndeficiency. Lack of normal reflexes, inability to orient itself,\nmuscle weekness, and loss of balance are typical symptoms\nof vitamin E deficiency in babies. Deficiency problems for\nindividuals in all three groups can be overcome by taking\nsupplementary vitamin E.\nInteresting Facts\nAs a general rule, vitamins\nand minerals are equally\npotent(effective)whetherthey\ncome from natural sources or\nsynthetic procedures. Vitamin\nE is an exception to that\ngeneral rule. Synthetic forms\nof the vitamin are generally\nless potent than natural\nforms. The reason for this\nfact is that natural vitamin E\nexists in only one stereo\nisomeric form. Stereo\nisomers are two or more\nforms of a compound with\nthe same kind and number\nof atoms. But the atoms in\nstereoisomers have some\nwhat different orientations\nin space. These slight dif\nferences in geometric shape\nare responsible for slight\ndifferences in biological\nactivity. Natural vitamin E\nconsists of only one stereo\nisomer, which is very active\nbiologically. Synthetic vita\nmin E consists of two\nstereoisomers, only one of\nwhich (the one that occurs\nin natural vitamin E) is bio\nlogically active.

Aspirin tablets themselves include only acetylsa-\nlicylic acid, to which is added a small amount of water, starch\nand lubricant that act as a binder to hold the tablet together.\nCOMMON USES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS\nThe exclusive use of aspirin is as a medicine. It has three\nimportant properties as a drug. It relieves pain, reduces\ninflammation, and reduces fever. In addition to its effective-\nness in treating these medical symptoms, it is inexpensive\nand available in a variety of forms, including chewable\ntablets, extended-release formulations, effervescent tablets,\nand even in chewing gums. Aspirin is often prescribed in low,\ndaily doses as a preventative measure for individuals at risk\nfor heart attack and stroke.\nWhile aspirin has many medical benefits, it is not with-\nout risk for some individuals. Some people are allergic to the\ncompound and can not tolerate even a low dose. Such indivi-\nduals experience a number of symptoms if they ingest high\ndoses of aspirin, symptoms that include ringing in the ears,\nnausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, coma,\nseizures, rapid breathing, fever, and, in the most severe\ncases, death. Aspirin use is not recommended in children\nunder the age of twelve who show symptoms of viral infec-\ntions because it can lead to an extremely rare but deadly\ncomplication known as Reye’s syndrome.\nF O R F U R T H E R I N F O R M A T I O N\nArnst, Catherine. ‘A Preemptive Strike against Cancer.’’ Business\nWeek (June 7, 2004): 48.\nWords to Know\nANALGESIC A substance that relieves pain.\nTHERAPEUTIC Having healing properties.\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n34\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n\n\n[Source 3 (Relevance: 0.635)]\ninflammation and swelling. Scientists believe that ibuprofen\nworks by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX),\nwhich converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Arachido-\nnic acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid that is used to\nbuild a number of important biochemical compounds, includ-\ning the prostaglandins. The prostaglandins are involved in\nthe transmission of pain impulses throughout the nervous\nsystem. If the COX enzyme is prevented from functioning,\narachidonic acid can not be converted into prostaglandins,\nand pain messages will not be transmitted.\nIbuprofen is especially effective in treating certain kinds\nof pain and inflammation, including those associated with\nmenstrual cramps, various kinds of arthritis, headaches and\nmigraines, pain from injuries and surgery, and discomfort\nassociated with influenza and gout.\nThe major risk associated with use of ibuprofen is sto-\nmach irritation. The inventors of ibuprofen had hoped to\nfind a substance that causes less stomach irritation than\naspirin. Ibuprofen does seem to cause fewer gastrointestinal\nproblems than does aspirin. Nevertheless, it can still cause\nsevere problems in some patients, especially those who take\nlarge doses. Common complaints from the use of ibuprofen\ninclude nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Patients who\nare especially sensitive or who take high doses of ibuprofen\nfor long periods may experience damage to the stomach\nlining.\nAs with any drug, some patients should avoid taking\nibuprofen entirely.

Scientists now know that the compound’s helpful\neffects come from its action on prostaglandins. Prostaglandins\nare hormone-like substances released by cells that are injured.\nThey cause the body to release other substances that sensitize\nnerve endings to pain and start the healing process. Aspirin\nblocks prostaglandin production, thus relieving the sensation\nof pain and the inflammation that are the body’s response to\ninjury. Aspirin reduces fever by acting on the region of the\nbrain that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Prosta-\nglandins block the body’s natural system for producing heat\nso that by blocking the release of prostaglandins, aspirin\nallows the regulation of body temperature to continue as\nusual. Aspirin’s protection against heart attack and stroke\noccur because of its effect on one special type of prostaglan-\ndin, known as thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 promotes\nthe accumulation of cells that takes place when a blood clot\nforms. By blocking or slowing down the production of throm-\nboxane A2, aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots and,\nhence, the probability of heart attack and stroke.\nHOW IT IS MADE\nThe modern method for making aspirin was developed in\n1897 by the German chemist Felix Hoffman (1868–1946), an\nemployee of the German chemical manufacturer Bayer AG\nChemical Works. In this procedure, phenol (C6H5OH) is treated\nwith sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide to make salicylic\nInteresting Facts\n• The name aspirin comes\nfrom a very old name for\nsalicylic acid, spiraeic acid.\n• After Hofmann’s discov-\nery, Bayer received a\nregistered trademark for\nthe name aspirin, meaning\nthat no other company\ncould use the name for\nacetylsalicylic acid. When\nGermany was defeated in\nWorld War I (1914–1918),\nAllied forces seized the\nBayer company’s property\nand possessions and made\nthe name available to all\ndrug manufacturers.\nCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS\n33\nACETYLSALICYLIC ACID\n\n\n[Source 5 (Relevance: 0.630)]\nchemical compounds\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC\nH3C\nOCC",
