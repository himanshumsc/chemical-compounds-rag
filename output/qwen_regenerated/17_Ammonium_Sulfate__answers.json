      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of ammonium sulfate?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for ammonium sulfate is (NH4)2SO4. The molecular weight is calculated by adding the atomic weights of the constituent elements:\n\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n- Sulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nThe formula is (NH4)2SO4, which means:\n\n- There are 2 nitrogen atoms: 2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol\n- There are 8 hydrogen atoms: 8 * 1.01 = 8.08 g/mol\n- There is 1 sulfur atom: 1 * 32.07 = 32.07 g/mol\n- There are 4 oxygen atoms: 4 * 16.00 = 64.00 g/mol\n\nAdding these together:\n28.02 + 8.08 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 132.17 g/mol\n\nSo, the molecular weight of ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4 is approximately 132.17 g/mol.",

      "question": "Explain why ammonium sulfate is primarily used in fertilizers.",
      "answer": "Ammonium sulfate, also known as ammonium sulphate, is a common fertilizer due to several properties that make it suitable for agricultural use:\n\n1. **High Nitrogen Content**: Ammonium sulfate contains 21% nitrogen by weight. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth, serving as a key component of chlorophyll (the green pigment in plants that enables photosynthesis) and other important proteins and enzymes. Plants require nitrogen for various functions including the development of healthy leaves, stems, and flowers, and for overall growth and vigor.\n\n2. **Solubility**: Ammonium sulfate is highly soluble in water, which means it dissolves easily in soil. This facilitates quick absorption by the roots, making it readily available for plant uptake. High solubility also means that it can be used in both liquid and dry forms, increasing its flexibility in application.\n\n3. **Nutritional Balance**: Unlike other nitrogen-rich fertilizers, such as urea or ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate also provides sulfur, which is essential for plant health. Sulfur is necessary for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll, and it enhances the efficiency of nitrogen in plant nutrition. This balanced nutrient profile makes ammonium sulfate particularly suitable for formulation of complete fertilizers.\n\n4. **Affordability**: Ammonium sulfate is fairly cheap compared to other nitrogen-based fertilizers. This cost-effectiveness makes it a popular choice for farmers on a budget, especially in large-scale agricultural practices.\n\n5. **Environmental Consideration**: Ammonium sulfate generally has a lower potential for nitrogen loss through volatilization compared to urea, making it a preferred choice in areas where minimizing nitrogen loss is a priority.\n\nThese properties collectively make ammonium sulfate an ideal choice for fertilizers, contributing to efficient plant nutrition and overall agricultural productivity.",

      "question": "Describe how ammonium sulfate is produced using gypsum, ammonia, and carbon dioxide.",
      "answer": "Ammonium sulfate can be produced through a process that involves reacting gypsum (mainly calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO₄·2H₂O) with ammonia (NH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). This process is often referred to as the FGD (Flue Gas Desulfurization) process, which is commonly used in the production of gypsum during the combustion of sulfur-containing fuels. Here's a step-by-step description of how this conversion occurs:\n\n1. **Gypsum Preparation**: Gypsum is a byproduct of the combustion process in power plants that burn sulfur-containing fuels. It is primarily calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O). Initially, the gypsum is a powder and is often already in a suitable form for use in the FGD process.\n\n2. **Ammonia Addition**: Ammonia gas (NH₃) is introduced into the gypsum. Ammonia reacts with the oxygen in the gypsum to form ammonium sulfate (NH₄)₂SO₄. This reaction is catalyzed by the presence of carbon dioxide:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{CaSO}_4 \\cdot 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{NH}_3 + \\text{CO}_2 \\rightarrow (\\text{NH}_4)_2 \\text{SO}_4 + \\text{CaCO}_3 \\cdot \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n   \\]\n\n   During this reaction, calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) is formed as a byproduct, which is typically removed as waste.\n\n3. **Product Formation**: The reaction between gypsum, ammonia, and carbon dioxide results in the formation of ammonium sulfate, which is the desired product. The reaction can be summarized as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{CaSO}_4 \\cdot 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 2\\text{NH}_3 + \\text{CO}_2 \\rightarrow (\\text{NH}_4)_2 \\text{SO}_4 + \\text{CaCO}_3 \\cdot \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n   \\]\n\n   Here, the ammonium sulfate (NH₄)₂SO₄ is the main product, while the calcium carbonate byproduct can be removed and disposed of or used for other purposes.\n\n4. **Ammonium Sulfate",
