      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of ethylene glycol?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for ethylene glycol is \\(\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_6\\text{O}_2\\). \n\nThe molecular weight of ethylene glyol can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of the constituent atoms:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nThe molecular weight of ethylene glycol is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of ethylene glycol} = 2 \\times \\text{C} + 6 \\times \\text{H} + 2 \\times \\text{O}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 2 \\times 12.01 + 6 \\times 1.01 + 2 \\times 16.00\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 24.02 + 6.06 + 32.00\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 62.08 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nSo, the molecular weight of ethylene glycol is approximately 62.08 g/mol.",

      "question": "Explain why ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants instead of plain water.",
      "answer": "Ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants instead of plain water primarily because it has superior antifreeze properties and is less likely to cause damage to the radiator's components, unlike plain water. Here are the key reasons:\n\n1. **Cooling Efficiency**: Ethylene glycol has a lower freezing point than plain water. It can remain in a liquid state at temperatures much lower than those at which water freezes, which is especially important for vehicles operating in cold climates. This property allows the coolant to effectively regulate the temperature of the engine, even in extremely cold conditions.\n\n2. **Boiling Point**: Ethylene glycol also has a higher boiling point than water. This means that it can remain liquid at higher temperatures, allowing the coolant to continue to perform its cooling function at engine operating temperatures without boiling off. This is crucial for maintaining consistent engine cooling.\n\n3. **Corrosion Resistance**: Plain water is highly corrosive and can damage the radiator and other metal parts in the cooling system, especially if it contains impurities such as minerals or rust. Ethylene glycol, on the other hand, has excellent corrosion inhibiting properties due to the presence of additives like corrosion inhibitors and other additives that are typically mixed with the ethylene glycol to form the final coolant mixture.\n\n4. **Anti-freeze Properties**: Ethylene glycol is a non-toxic and non-corrosive liquid that is mixed with water to create a corrosion-resistant coolant. When mixed with water, ethylene glycol forms a solution that has a lower freezing point than plain water, thus preventing the coolant from freezing in cold conditions.\n\n5. **Safety Concerns**: Plain water can be toxic if ingested, especially in large quantities. Ethylene glycol is also toxic, but it has a higher lethal dose than plain water, making it safer for use in the cooling system. However, it is important to note that ethylene glycol is toxic and should be handled with proper safety precautions and disposed of appropriately.\n\n6. **Color and Odor**: Ethylene glycol is typically dyed a bright color (pink or green) and has a distinct odor. This helps in identifying coolant leaks and ensures that any leaks can be easily located and addressed.\n\nIn summary, ethylene glycol is used in radiator coolants because it offers better freezing resistance, higher boiling point, corrosion resistance, and safety properties compared to plain water. These properties make ethylene glycol an ideal choice for vehicle cooling systems.",

      "question": "Describe the primary industrial method for producing ethylene glycol and discuss its efficiency.",
      "answer": "Ethylene glycol is a versatile chemical used in various applications such as antifreeze, pharmaceuticals, and plasticizers. One of the primary industrial methods for producing ethylene glycol is through the oxidation of ethylene, a process known as the ethylene glycol oxidation process or the ethylene glycol route.\n\n### Ethylene Glycol Oxidation Process\n\n1. **Raw Materials:**\n   - Ethylene is the primary starting material.\n   - Oxygen or air is used as the oxidizing agent.\n\n2. **Process Steps:**\n   - Ethylene is passed over a catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor.\n   - The reaction occurs at a temperature of around 250°C.\n   - Oxygen or air is passed over the ethylene in the presence of a catalyst. The most common catalysts include copper-based catalysts and cobalt-based catalysts.\n\n3. **Reaction Equation:**\n   - Ethylene + Oxygen → Ethylene Glycol + Water\n   - C2H4 + O2 → C2H4O2 + H2O\n\n### Process Efficiency\n\nThe efficiency of the ethylene glycol oxidation process depends on several factors:\n\n- **Catalyst Activity:** The efficiency of the catalyst determines how quickly the ethylene is converted to ethylene glycol. High activity catalysts can increase production rates.\n- **Reaction Conditions:** The temperature and pressure conditions play a crucial role. Optimal conditions ensure a high conversion rate without producing by-products.\n- **Ethylene Availability:** The purity and availability of ethylene are critical. Contaminants can inhibit the reaction, thus reducing overall efficiency.\n- **By-products:** The presence of by-products can reduce the purity of the ethylene glycol produced. Advanced separation technologies can help in purifying the final product.\n\n### Environmental Considerations\n\nThe ethylene glycol oxidation process is relatively clean compared to some other chemical production methods. However, it does produce some waste gases which can be managed by scrubbing and gas treatment systems. The by-products are usually recycled or sold as other useful chemicals.\n\n### Economic Feasibility\n\nThe economics of the ethylene glycol oxidation process depend on the cost of raw materials, energy, and the demand for ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is a commodity chemical, and its market prices are influenced by global supply and demand dynamics. Efficient operation and continuous improvement in the process can help in maintaining a competitive edge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ethylene gly",
