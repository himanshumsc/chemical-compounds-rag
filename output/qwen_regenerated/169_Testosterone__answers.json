      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of testosterone?",
      "answer": "Testosterone is a hormone which plays a significant role in the growth and development of male tissues. Its chemical formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{C}_{19} \\text{H}_{28} \\text{O}_2 \\]\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of testosterone, you need to sum the atomic weights of its constituent elements:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nThe molecular weight (M) of testosterone is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ M = 19 \\times 12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 28 \\times 1.008 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 2 \\times 16.00 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\n\\[ M = 19 \\times 12.01 + 28 \\times 1.008 + 2 \\times 16.00 \\]\n\n\\[ M = 228.19 + 28.224 + 32.00 \\]\n\n\\[ M = 288.414 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of testosterone is approximately 288.414 g/mol.",

      "question": "Explain how testosterone affects the development of male sexual characteristics.",
      "answer": "Testosterone is a key hormone in the development of male sexual characteristics, also known as male sex differentiation. It plays a critical role in the development of male reproductive organs, and it also influences the development of secondary sexual characteristics during puberty.\n\n1. Reproductive organs: Testosterone is involved in the development of the male reproductive organs such as the testes and penis, and in the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Testosterone stimulates the growth of the testes and the development of the male reproductive tract. It also promotes the development of male secondary sexual characteristics like the beard and body hair.\n\n2. Secondary sexual characteristics: During puberty, testosterone promotes the development of secondary sexual characteristics, which are the physical features that differentiate males from females. These characteristics include body hair, facial hair, deepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, and the growth of the penis and testes.\n\nIt's worth noting that testosterone plays a crucial role in male sexual development, but it is not the only factor. Other factors, such as genetics, hormones, and environment, also influence the development of male sexual characteristics. In cases where individuals have an excess or deficiency of testosterone, they may experience difficulties with sexual development.",

      "question": "Describe the synthesis process of testosterone and its applications in medical treatments.",
      "answer": "Testosterone is a steroid hormone that plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics and is also important in the general metabolism and reproduction of both males and females. The synthesis process of testosterone primarily occurs in the Leydig cells of the testes in males and to a lesser extent in the adrenal cortex in females. This synthesis process involves several steps and enzymes.\n\n### Synthesis Process of Testosterone:\n\n1. **Cholesterol Conversion to pregnenolone**: This initial step is catalyzed by the enzyme cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). In this step, cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone, which is a precursor for several hormones, including testosterone.\n\n2. **Pregnenolone Conversion to androstenedione**: This conversion occurs in the adrenal glands and Leydig cells and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450c17. Pregnenolone is then converted into androstenedione, another precursor for testosterone.\n\n3. **Conversion of androstenedione to testosterone**: The enzyme 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17) catalyzes this final conversion. In this step, androstenedione is converted into testosterone.\n\n### Applications in Medical Treatments:\n\n1. **Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)**: \n   - **Condition**: Hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) in males, and low libido, muscle wasting, and other symptoms in women.\n   - **Purpose**: To restore a person's testosterone levels to a normal range and relieve symptoms associated with low testosterone levels.\n   - **Delivery**:\n     - **Oral**: Testosterone can be taken by mouth as a tablet or gel.\n     - **Topical**: Testosterone can be applied to the skin as a cream or gel.\n     - **Transdermal Patch**: Testosterone is applied to the skin as a patch.\n     - **Implantable Pellets**: Testosterone is encapsulated in biodegradable pellets that are surgically inserted under the skin.\n\n2. **Testosterone for male fertility treatment**: \n   - **Condition**: Impaired fertility in males.\n   - **Purpose**: To stimulate spermatogenesis and improve sperm quality.\n   - **Delivery**:\n     - **Oral**: Testosterone can be taken by mouth as a tablet.\n     - **Topical**: Testosterone can",
