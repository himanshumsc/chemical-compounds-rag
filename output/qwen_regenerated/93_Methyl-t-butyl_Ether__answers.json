      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Methyl-t-butyl Ether?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for Methyl-t-butyl Ether (MTBE) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O} \\]\n\nTo calculate its molecular weight, we sum the atomic weights of each element:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nMTBE's molecular weight is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 12.01 \\, (\\text{g/mol}) + 12 \\times 1.008 \\, (\\text{g/mol}) + 1 \\times 16.00 \\, (\\text{g/mol}) \\]\n\n\\[ = 60.05 \\, (\\text{g/mol}) + 12.096 \\, (\\text{g/mol}) + 16.00 \\, (\\text{g/mol}) \\]\n\n\\[ = 88.146 \\, (\\text{g/mol}) \\]\n\nSo, the molecular weight of Methyl-t-butyl Ether is approximately 88.146 g/mol.",

      "question": "Explain the significance of Methyl-t-butyl Ether's azeotropic mixture with water.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE) is a colorless, flammable, and volatile liquid that is widely used as a fuel additive to increase the octane rating of gasoline. One of the key properties of MTBE that makes it useful is its ability to form an azeotropic mixture with water. \n\nAn azeotropic mixture is a mixture of two or more components where the boiling point of the mixture is lower than the boiling point of each individual component when present in their pure state. This property makes the mixture behave as a pure component in terms of its volatility, which is particularly useful in the context of distillation processes.\n\nThe azeotropic mixture of MTBE and water has a boiling point of approximately 65°C (149°F) at a pressure of 1 atm (101,325 Pa), which is lower than the boiling point of MTBE itself (55°C or 131°F) and also lower than the boiling point of water (100°C or 212°F). This means that when MTBE is mixed with water, they will boil together at the same temperature and can be easily separated by simple distillation.\n\nThe significance of this azeotropic mixture is that it allows for the efficient separation of MTBE from water in the production of fuel blends. This is particularly important because MTBE is considered harmful to the environment and groundwater, and its use has been gradually phased out in many parts of the world due to concerns about its carcinogenicity and potential for groundwater contamination. However, the azeotropic mixture with water makes it possible to recover and reuse MTBE from spent fuel blends, which is environmentally beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, the azeotropic nature of MTBE and water is significant because it allows for the efficient recovery and reuse of MTBE, which would not be possible if they were not to mix with each other. This property makes it easier to separate and recycle MTBE, which is environmentally beneficial.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical context and environmental impact that led to the use of Methyl-t-butyl Ether as a gasoline additive.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE) was widely used as an oxygenate additive in gasoline due to its high octane rating and its ability to enhance the energy content of gasoline. It was also promoted as a cleaner-burning fuel as it contributed to the reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in gasoline, which are significant contributors to urban smog.\n\nThe historical context for the use of MTBE in gasoline can be traced back to the 1970s, when the United States and other developed countries were experiencing a surge in energy shortages and rising air pollution levels. It became crucial to develop cleaner-burning fuels that would reduce the harmful emissions from motor vehicles and the overall pollution levels in the air. MTBE was a potential solution to these problems due to its high octane number and chemical properties that make it incompatible with water.\n\nThe environmental impact of MTBE began to unravel in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. As it became more widely used in gasoline, it was discovered that MTBE could leach into groundwater, leading to contamination in drinking water. The chemical is not easily broken down in the environment and remains toxic for long periods. MTBE can cause reproductive and developmental problems in animals and may have adverse health effects on humans.\n\nIn 2006, many states in the US began phasing out MTBE use in gasoline due to its groundwater contamination issues. Synthetic oxygenates such as ethanol, butanol, and methanol were promoted as cleaner, more sustainable solutions. MTBE production has since decreased significantly worldwide, with many countries banning or phasing out its use in gasoline.",
