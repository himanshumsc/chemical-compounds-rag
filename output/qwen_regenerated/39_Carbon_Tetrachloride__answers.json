      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). Carbon tetrachloride is a compound consisting of one carbon atom (represented in black) and four chlorine atoms (represented in green). All the bonds between the carbon and chlorine atoms are single bonds.\n\nKey properties of carbon tetrachloride include:\n- **Boiling Point**: It boils at approximately -22°C.\n- **Melting Point**: It has a low melting point, melting at -123°C.\n- **Solubility**: It is highly soluble in water, making it useful as a solvent.\n- **Reactivity**: It is relatively inert under normal conditions and does not react with most other substances.\n- **Health Effects**: It is toxic if inhaled or ingested. High exposure can lead to liver damage and liver failure.\n\nCarbon tetrachloride was initially used as a refrigerant, blowing agent, solvent, and cleaning agent, but its production was later reduced due to its potential harm to the Earth's ozone layer, as discovered by chemists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Carbon Tetrachloride?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula for carbon tetrachloride is \\( \\text{CCl}_4 \\). \n\nTo determine the molecular weight, we sum the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01 g/mol.\n- Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic weight of approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\nThe molecular weight of carbon tetrachloride is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of } \\text{CCl}_4 = 1 \\times \\text{Atomic weight of C} + 4 \\times \\text{Atomic weight of Cl}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of } \\text{CCl}_4 = 1 \\times 12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 4 \\times 35.45 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of } \\text{CCl}_4 = 12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 141.80 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of } \\text{CCl}_4 = 153.81 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n\\]\n\nSo, the molecular weight of carbon tetrachloride is approximately 153.81 g/mol.",

      "question": "Why is Carbon Tetrachloride classified as a halogenated hydrocarbon?",
      "answer": "Carbon Tetrachloride, also known as CCl₄, is classified as a halogenated hydrocarbon because it is a compound that contains both a carbon atom and a chlorine atom. Specifically, it is a chlorinated hydrocarbon because:\n\n1. It contains chlorine (Cl), which is one of the halogens.\n2. It also contains hydrogen (H), which is a hydrocarbon component.\n\nThe term \"halogenated hydrocarbon\" (or chlorinated hydrocarbon in the specific case of carbon tetrachloride) refers to a compound where at least one of the hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon is replaced by a halogen atom. Halogens are a group of non-metallic elements that include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At).\n\nIn the case of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄), each of the four hydrogen atoms in a methane (CH₄) molecule is replaced by a chlorine atom. Therefore, it fits the definition of a chlorinated hydrocarbon.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl₄) is a halogenated hydrocarbon because it contains both chlorine (Cl, a halogen) and hydrogen (H, a hydrocarbon component).\n- The replacement of hydrogen by halogen atoms is what defines a halogenated hydrocarbon.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical applications of Carbon Tetrachloride and the reasons for the decline in its usage.",
      "answer": "### Historical Applications of Carbon Tetrachloride\n\nCarbon Tetrachloride (CCl₄) is a colorless, non-flammable liquid with a sweet odor. Historically, it has had a range of uses, particularly in various industrial and scientific applications. Here are the main historical uses of Carbon Tetrachloride:\n\n1. **Fire Suppression**: One of the earliest uses of Carbon Tetrachloride was as a fire suppressant. It was used in fire extinguishers and was particularly effective in combatting fires involving organic materials and flammable liquids. However, its use has since been discontinued due to environmental concerns.\n\n2. **Industrial Cleaning**: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Carbon Tetrachloride was widely used as a cleaner in industries such as textiles, paper, and printing. It was also used as a solvent in paint and ink production.\n\n3. **Laboratory Use**: In the laboratory, Carbon Tetrachloride was used as a solvent for various chemical reactions. It was particularly useful as a solvent for non-polar compounds.\n\n4. **Medical Purpose**: Before the discovery of safer alternatives, Carbon Tetrachloride was used in some medical applications as a solvent for medicines and in some chemical processing.\n\n### Reasons for the Decline in Usage\n\nThe decline in the use of Carbon Tetrachloride can be attributed to a combination of factors, including regulatory measures, safety concerns, and the discovery of safer alternatives:\n\n1. **Environmental Concerns**: The primary reason for the decline in Carbon Tetrachloride's use is its environmental impact. Carbon Tetrachloride is considered a persistent organic pollutant because it persists in the environment and bioaccumulates in organisms. It is a potent neurotoxin and carcinogen, posing significant health risks to humans and wildlife. Its use has been banned in several countries due to these concerns.\n\n2. **Regulatory Restrictions**: International agreements like the Stockholm Convention have significantly impacted the use of Carbon Tetrachloride. Signed in 2001, the Convention aimed to eliminate or restrict the production and use of 12 persistent organic pollutants, including Carbon Tetrachloride. The convention has led to the phasing out of the chemical in many countries.\n\n3. **Safety Regulations**: Since Carbon Tetrachloride is highly toxic and can cause severe health effects, various countries and organizations",
