      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows the structure of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃). Here are its key properties:\n\n1. **Chemical Compound Structure**:\n   - Sodium bicarbonate is composed of sodium (Na), hydrogen (H), and carbon (C) atoms, with oxygen (O) atoms present in the form of double bonds with carbon.\n   - The diagram indicates that:\n     - Sodium (Na) is represented by the turquoise sphere.\n     - Hydrogen (H) is represented by the white sphere.\n     - Carbon (C) is represented by the black sphere.\n     - Oxygen (O) is represented by the red spheres.\n\n2. **Key Properties**:\n   - **Leavening Agent**: Sodium bicarbonate is a safe and commonly used leavening agent in baking due to its ability to produce carbon dioxide gas when heated in the presence of an acid, causing the batter to rise.\n   - **Human Consumption**: It is safe for human consumption and is often used in baking and other culinary applications.\n   - **Double Bond Indication**: The presence of red spheres with double bonds indicates the carbon-oxygen double bonds, a characteristic of carbonic acid and bicarbonate ions.\n\nThis compound is widely used in various applications, including baking, where it helps to create light and fluffy baked goods.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of sodium bicarbonate?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula of sodium bicarbonate is NaHCO₃. \n\nTo determine the molecular weight, we need to add up the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n\n- Sodium (Na): 22.99\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01\n- Carbon (C): 12.01\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00\n\nSo, the molecular weight of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular Weight} = 22.99 + 1.01 + 12.01 + (3 \\times 16.00)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular Weight} = 22.99 + 1.01 + 12.01 + 48.00\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular Weight} = 84.01 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of sodium bicarbonate is 84.01 g/mol.",

      "question": "Why is sodium bicarbonate considered an acid salt and what happens to it when heated?",
      "answer": "Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, is considered an acid salt because it is a compound formed by a base (sodium hydroxide, \\(\\text{NaOH}\\)) and a weak acid (carbonic acid, \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3\\)). When carbonic acid is neutralized by a base, it forms sodium bicarbonate. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{NaOH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{NaHCO}_3\n\\]\n\nIn this reaction, sodium bicarbonate (\\(\\text{NaHCO}_3\\)) is the salt formed from the neutralization of carbonic acid by sodium hydroxide.\n\nWhen sodium bicarbonate is heated, it decomposes into sodium carbonate (a salt), carbon dioxide, and water vapor. This reaction can be understood as follows:\n\n\\[\n2\\text{NaHCO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{CO}_2\n\\]\n\nThis decomposition reaction is what gives sodium bicarbonate its characteristic \"baking\" properties. The heat causes the particles to expand and release carbon dioxide gas, which makes the dough rise, thus making it a leavening agent commonly used in baking.\n\nIn summary, sodium bicarbonate is an acid salt because it is formed by the neutralization of a weak acid with a base, and when heated, it decomposes into sodium carbonate, water, and carbon dioxide.",

      "question": "Describe the historical uses of sodium bicarbonate and explain its function as a leavening agent in baking.",
      "answer": "Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, has a long history of use and has been found in various cultural and historical practices. Its origins date back to ancient civilizations where it was used in various forms, including the Egyptians and the Romans, who used it for its antibacterial properties and as a mordant for dyeing fabrics. However, its widespread use as a leavening agent in baking primarily developed in the 19th century.\n\n**Historical Uses:**\n\n1. **Medicinal Uses:** Sodium bicarbonate has been used for centuries to treat conditions such as acid indigestion and heartburn. In ancient Egypt, it was also used as a poultice to treat wounds and burns.\n\n2. **Baking:** Sodium bicarbonate was used in early baking as a leavening agent. In the 19th century, the use of baking soda in cakes and other baked goods became more widespread due to its ability to provide consistent and reliable leavening.\n\n3. **Textile Dyeing:** As a mordant, sodium bicarbonate enhances the colorfastness of dyes in textiles.\n\n4. **Cooking:** Beyond baking, sodium bicarbonate is also used to adjust the pH of soups and sauces, making them more palatable.\n\n**Function as a Leavening Agent:**\n\nThe primary function of sodium bicarbonate in baking is to act as a leavening agent. This means it helps to increase the volume of baked goods by producing carbon dioxide gas. When combined with an acidic ingredient (such as vinegar or lemon juice) and water, it undergoes a chemical reaction that causes the formation of carbon dioxide gas. This gas expands the batter, causing the baked good to rise and become light and airy.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n- The baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is mixed with an acidic ingredient.\n- When the acidic ingredient comes into contact with the baking soda, a chemical reaction occurs.\n- This reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, which can be seen as bubbles forming in the batter.\n- The carbon dioxide gas trapped in the batter causes it to expand, thus leavening the batter.\n- This leavening action leads to the rise of the baked good, resulting in a light and airy texture.\n\nUsing sodium bicarbonate as a leavening agent requires some care. The acidic ingredient and water should be added to the baking soda, rather than the other way around, to prevent the immediate",
