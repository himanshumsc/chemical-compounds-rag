      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram in the image shows iron(II) oxide, also known as ferrous oxide. The key properties of iron(II) oxide include:\n\n1. **Chemical Formula**: It has the chemical formula FeO.\n2. **Appearance**: It appears as a dark, nearly jet black compound.\n3. **Occurrence**: It is abundant in rocks on the surface of Mars, contributing to the dark color of some Martian rocks.\n4. **Red Color Contribution**: Iron(III) oxide (hematite) is responsible for the predominant red color of the Martian surface.\n5. **Use**: It is used as a raw material in the production of steel and as a catalyst in various industrial and chemical operations.\n6. **Health Hazard**: Inhalation of iron(II) oxide fumes or dust can be hazardous and can cause throat and nasal irritation. High levels of exposure can lead to metal fume fever, a workplace exposure illness causing flu-like symptoms, and continued exposure at high levels can result in siderosis, a lung inflammation accompanied by pneumonia-like symptoms.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Iron(II) Oxide?",
      "answer": "Iron(II) oxide, also known as ferrous oxide, is a compound with the chemical formula FeO. Its molecular weight can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n\n- Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of approximately 55.847 g/mol.\n- Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 15.999 g/mol.\n\nNow, calculate the molecular weight of FeO:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of FeO} = \\text{Atomic weight of Fe} + \\text{Atomic weight of O}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of FeO} = 55.847 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 15.999 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Molecular weight of FeO} = 71.846 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n\\]\n\nSo, the chemical formula for Iron(II) oxide is FeO, and its molecular weight is approximately 71.846 g/mol.",

      "question": "What are the solubility properties of Iron(II) Oxide and how does it react with other compounds?",
      "answer": "Iron(II) oxide, also known as rustless iron or ferric oxide, has the chemical formula FeO. It is a black, dark red, or dark brown powder, depending on its degree of oxidation. \n\n### Solubility Properties:\nIron(II) oxide is insoluble in water. It does not dissolve in water and forms a suspension or colloidal solution. This means that it does not react with water to form a soluble compound.\n\n### Reaction with Other Compounds:\nIron(II) oxide is relatively inert and does not react with many compounds because it is not easily reduced or oxidized. However, it can react under certain conditions:\n\n1. **Reduction:**\n   Iron(II) oxide can be reduced to iron metal (Fe) in the presence of hydrogen gas (H₂) or other reducing agents. This reaction releases energy and is often used in the production of iron from iron(II) oxide.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{FeO} + \\text{H}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{Fe} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Oxidation:**\n   Iron(II) oxide can be oxidized to iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) in the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agents. This process is known as rusting.\n\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{FeO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2 \\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3\n   \\]\n   \n   Iron(II) oxide can also be oxidized to iron(III) oxide with a mild acid like nitric acid (HNO₃).\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{FeO} + 2 \\text{HNO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3 + 2 \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{NO}_2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Reaction with Strong Acids:**\n   When exposed to strong acids such as sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) or nitric acid (HNO₃), iron(II) oxide can be dissolved, forming soluble iron(II) salts. This reaction is often used to treat waste water containing iron(II) ions.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{FeO} + \\text{H}_2",

      "question": "How is Iron(II) Oxide prepared synthetically and what impurity may be present in the product?",
      "answer": "Iron(II) oxide, commonly known as magnetite or lodestone, is a mineral and can also be prepared synthetically. Here's how it can be synthesized, along with a note on potential impurities:\n\n### Preparation of Iron(II) Oxide Synthetically:\n\n1. **Combustion of Iron:**\n   Iron can be burned in the presence of an oxygen source to produce Iron(II) oxide. This is a simple combustion reaction:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fe} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{FeO}\n   \\]\n   However, this method might not yield pure Iron(II) oxide due to the partial oxidation of iron.\n\n2. **Reduction of Iron(III) Oxide:**\n   Iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃), also known as hematite, can be reduced to Iron(II) oxide. This can be done by heating it in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3 + 3\\text{CO} \\rightarrow 2\\text{FeO} + 3\\text{CO}_2\n   \\]\n   The CO serves as a reducing agent.\n\n3. **Electrochemical Synthesis:**\n   In a more controlled environment, Iron(II) oxide can be synthesized via an electrolytic process. This involves passing an electric current through an aqueous solution of iron(II) salts:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fe}^{2+} + 2\\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{FeO(OH)} + \\text{H}_2\n   \\]\n\n### Potential Impurities in Synthetic Iron(II) Oxide:\n\n1. **Iron(III) Oxide (Hematite):**\n   If the iron(II) oxide is not fully reduced or if the synthesis conditions are not controlled, it could contain significant amounts of Iron(III) oxide. This is because iron(II) can be readily oxidized to iron(III) under many conditions.\n\n2. **Carbon Monoxide (CO):**\n   If the reduction process is not complete, carbon monoxide may remain in the product as an impurity or decompose into carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n\n3. **Water (H₂O):**\n   If the synthetic process is not carried out in a completely dry environment, water can",
