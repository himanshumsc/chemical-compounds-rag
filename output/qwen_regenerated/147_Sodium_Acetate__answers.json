      "question": "What is the chemical formula of sodium acetate and its molecular weight?",
      "answer": "The chemical formula of sodium acetate is \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COONa} \\). This can also be written as \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- \\text{Na}^+ \\).\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of sodium acetate, we sum the atomic weights of all the atoms in the formula:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n- Sodium (Na): 22.99 g/mol\n\nThe formula \\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COONa} \\) contains:\n- 2 carbon (C) atoms: \\( 2 \\times 12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 24.02 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n- 4 hydrogen (H) atoms: \\( 4 \\times 1.01 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 4.04 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n- 2 oxygen (O) atoms: \\( 2 \\times 16.00 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 32.00 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n- 1 sodium (Na) atom: \\( 1 \\times 22.99 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 22.99 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 24.02 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 4.04 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 32.00 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 22.99 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 103.05 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nSo, the molecular weight of sodium acetate is \\( 103.05 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\).",

      "question": "Explain the process of how sodium acetate is prepared using sodium hydroxide and acetic acid.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is a salt formed by the reaction of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with acetic acid (CH₃COOH). It can be prepared by neutralizing acetic acid with sodium hydroxide, or through the reverse reaction, where sodium acetate is neutralized by sodium hydroxide to form sodium hydroxide and acetic acid. However, the direct reverse reaction is not practical because the reverse reaction is not favorable due to the weak acid nature of acetic acid.\n\nThe preparation process typically involves the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Preparation of Sodium Acetate from Sodium Hydroxide and Acetic Acid\n1. **Mix Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) Solution**: Dissolve sodium hydroxide in water to make a sodium hydroxide solution.\n2. **Mix Acetic Acid Solution**: Dissolve acetic acid in water to make an acetic acid solution.\n3. **Neutralization Reaction**: Add the sodium hydroxide solution to the acetic acid solution slowly while stirring. The reaction equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{NaOH} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COONa} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n   \\]\n   This reaction produces sodium acetate and water.\n\n### Step 2: Precipitation and Crystallization\n1. **Precipitation**: After mixing, the sodium acetate will precipitate out of the solution as a white solid.\n2. **Crystallization**: Filter the mixture to remove the undissolved sodium acetate. The filtrate can be concentrated further by evaporation to enhance the crystallization process.\n3. **Drying**: Dry the sodium acetate crystals to remove any remaining water. This can be done by oven drying or by using a vacuum desiccator.\n\n### Step 3: Purification\n1. **Solvent Extraction**: Sometimes, the sodium acetate can be purified further by extracting it with a suitable organic solvent like ethanol or methanol, then evaporating the solvent to get pure sodium acetate.\n2. **Recrystallization**: Alternatively, you can recrystallize the sodium acetate by dissolving it in a suitable solvent (like water or ethanol) and then allowing it to cool to cause crystallization.\n\n### Final Product\nThe final product is sodium acet",

      "question": "Discuss why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and describe its physical properties that make it suitable for this application.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is a widely used compound in the textile industry due to several advantageous properties that make it an essential component in dyeing and finishing processes. Its use is particularly prevalent in the treatment of wool, cotton, and synthetic fibers, including nylon and acrylic. Here are the reasons why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and its physical properties that make it suitable for this application:\n\n### Reasons Sodium Acetate is Used:\n\n1. **Buffering Solution**: Sodium acetate is a weak acid that forms a buffer solution with its conjugate base, sodium acetate. This buffer solution helps maintain a stable pH environment during dyeing and other textile treatment processes. Buffering is crucial because it prevents the pH from dropping too low, which can lead to undesirable chemical reactions or damage to fibers.\n\n2. **Stabilizing Dyes**: Sodium acetate is used in conjunction with other chemicals to enhance the stability of the dyes. It can help in stabilizing the dye molecules, preventing them from bleeding or fading, which is essential for achieving durable and long-lasting colors.\n\n3. **Texturizing Agents**: In some processes, sodium acetate is used to create a specific texture or finish on the fabric. It can act as a texturizing agent, contributing to the appearance and feel of the fabric without altering its basic properties.\n\n4. **Solubility**: Sodium acetate is highly soluble in water, which makes it easy to dissolve and mix with other materials. This solubility is vital for creating stable solutions that can be applied evenly across the fabric.\n\n5. **Cost-effectiveness**: Sodium acetate is relatively inexpensive compared to many other chemicals used in textile production. This cost-effectiveness makes it a preferred choice for many textile manufacturers.\n\n### Physical Properties of Sodium Acetate:\n\n1. **Chemical Formula**: Sodium acetate has the chemical formula NaCH₃CO₂, which indicates that it consists of sodium, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.\n\n2. **Appearance**: Sodium acetate appears as a white or slightly off-white crystalline powder. It has a mild, slightly salty odor.\n\n3. **Solubility**: Sodium acetate is highly soluble in water and alcohol, making it versatile for use in various textile treatments.\n\n4. **Melting Point**: Sodium acetate has a melting point of approximately 50°C (122°F). This low melting point allows it to be readily incorporated into textile formulations without affecting the process",
