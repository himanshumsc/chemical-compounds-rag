      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of Nitrous Oxide and its implications for usage.",
      "answer": "Nitrous Oxide is sparingly soluble in water but highly soluble in organic solvents. This property makes it soluble in fats and oils, which is why it is used as anesthetic in medical settings.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical discovery and early experimentation of Nitrous Oxide.",
      "answer": "Nitrous oxide was first recognized as a unique compound in 1772 by Joseph Priestley. He named it nitrous oxide but its significance was not immediately appreciated. In 1799, Humphry Davy conducted experiments with nitrous oxide, noting its effects on mood and behavior. Despite these early studies, nitrous oxide's applications were not widely explored until the mid-19th century, when it was used as an anesthetic during dental procedures.",
