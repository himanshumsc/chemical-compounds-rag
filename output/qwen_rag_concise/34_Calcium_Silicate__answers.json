      "question": "Explain why calcium silicate does not have a boiling point and describe its solubility properties.",
      "answer": "Calcium silicate (Ca2SiO4) is a refractory material with a high melting point (1550°C), making it non-combustible and resistant to most solvents. It does not have a boiling point, as it is a solid and melts before boiling. Soluble in water and most organic solvents, it is slowly soluble in basic solutions.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing calcium silicate for commercial applications and state why synthetic preparation might be preferred over extraction from natural sources.",
      "answer": "Calcium silicate is typically produced synthetically by mixing calcium oxide (CaO) with silicic acid (SiO2) in a kiln. This process can be optimized to control the molecular structure and purity of the final product. Synthetic preparation is preferred over extraction from natural sources due to better control over the chemical composition and purity of the final product, as well as the ability to tailor the product's properties for specific applications.",
