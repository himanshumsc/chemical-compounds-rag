      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows benzene (C6H6). It has six carbon atoms arranged in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon. Benzene has three double bonds and three single bonds alternating in the ring. It is a stable aromatic compound.",

      "question": "Explain why benzene's chemical structure was considered a mystery and how Friedrich August Kekulé contributed to understanding it.",
      "answer": "Benzene's structure was initially seen as a puzzle due to its cyclic nature, where carbon atoms form a ring without any single or double bonds, violating the valence theory. Friedrich August Kekulé proposed that benzene's structure could be cyclic with alternating single and double bonds. However, his vivid dream of a snake biting its own tail led him to suggest a cyclic structure with a single bond between each carbon atom, as if the double bonds were alternating in a continuous chain. This led to the formation of benzene's cyclic structure, effectively resolving the mystery.",
