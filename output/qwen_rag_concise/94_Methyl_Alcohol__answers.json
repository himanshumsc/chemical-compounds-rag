      "question": "Explain how methyl alcohol is commercially produced.",
      "answer": "Methyl alcohol, or methanol, is produced by the reforming of natural gas or coal. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are produced from the reforming process. These gases are then catalytically hydrogenated to produce methanol. The reaction can be summarized as CO + 3H2 → CH3OH + H2O. This process is widely used in the chemical industry for methanol production.",

      "question": "Discuss the environmental concerns associated with the use of methyl alcohol in producing MTBE and the impact on its demand.",
      "answer": "Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is used as an oxygenate additive in gasoline to improve octane ratings and reduce carbon monoxide emissions. However, MTBE leaks into groundwater and has been found to be toxic to aquatic life. MTBE has also been classified as a possible human carcinogen. Efforts to phase out MTBE and replace it with alternative oxygenates like ethanol and 1,3-butadiene have led to decreased demand for methyl alcohol in the production of MTBE.",
