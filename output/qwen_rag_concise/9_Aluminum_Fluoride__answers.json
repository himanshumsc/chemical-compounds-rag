      "question": "Explain the significance of Aluminum Fluoride in the production of aluminum metal and its other industrial applications.",
      "answer": "Aluminum fluoride is a stable compound used in the production of aluminum metal. It reacts with aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) during the Bayer process to produce aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). The aluminum oxide is then reduced to aluminum metal using carbon as a reducing agent. Additionally, aluminum fluoride is used in various industrial applications, such as in the chemical industry, where it resists strong solvents and is incorporated into various products.",
