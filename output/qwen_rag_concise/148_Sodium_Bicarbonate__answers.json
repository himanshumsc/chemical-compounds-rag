      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). It's composed of sodium, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Safe for human consumption, it's an ideal leavening agent and used in cooking, cleaning, and deodorizing homes.",

      "question": "Why is sodium bicarbonate considered an acid salt and what happens to it when heated?",
      "answer": "Sodium bicarbonate is an acid salt because it is formed from the reaction of a weak acid (sodium acid) with a strong base (carbonate). When heated, it decomposes into sodium carbonate, water, and carbon dioxide. This reaction is represented by the equation: NaHCO₃ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O + CO₂.",

      "question": "Describe the historical uses of sodium bicarbonate and explain its function as a leavening agent in baking.",
      "answer": "Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, has been used in baking for centuries. Initially, it was used as a leavening agent in breads and pastries. Its function in baking is due to the carbon dioxide gas it releases during baking, which expands the dough and creates a light, airy texture. Sodium bicarbonate is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, in food processing, and in various household cleaning products.",
