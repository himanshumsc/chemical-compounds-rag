      "question": "Explain the synthesis process of Mercury(II) Sulfide and how its different forms are produced.",
      "answer": "Mercury(II) Sulfide is synthesized by combining mercury II ions (Hg²⁺) with sulfide (S²⁻) ions. It forms primarily as a black, insoluble solid, though some forms can be colorless under different conditions.",
