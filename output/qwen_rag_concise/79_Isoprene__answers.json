      "question": "Explain why isoprene is classified as an alkadiene and as a member of the terpene family.",
      "answer": "Isoprene is an alkadiene because its formula, CH2=C(CH2)2CH=CH2, contains two double bonds (C=C). It belongs to the terpene family because terpenes are hydrocarbons with a molecular formula of (C5H8)n, where n is an integer. Isoprene fits this pattern as it has a molecular formula of C5H8.",

      "question": "Discuss the environmental impact of isoprene and its role in the synthesis of other compounds in the body.",
      "answer": "Isoprene is a hydrocarbon that is produced by plants and contributes to Earth's atmosphere. It plays a role in the synthesis of other compounds in the body, such as cholesterol and terpenes. However, its environmental impact is not directly relevant to its role in the body.",
