    {
      "question": "Explain why Ethylene is classified as an unsaturated hydrocarbon.",
      "answer": "Ethylene is classified as an unsaturated hydrocarbon because it contains a double bond (C=C) between two carbon atoms, which means it has fewer hydrogen atoms than the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (C2H6).",

      "question": "Discuss the role of Ethylene as a plant hormone and provide an example of its historical use.",
      "answer": "Ethylene is a plant hormone that acts as a ripening agent. Historically, it was used to speed up the ripening process in fruits and vegetables. For example, ethylene gas, such as from ethyleneimine, has been used in the oil industry to improve the flow of oil from wells, known as gas lift.",
