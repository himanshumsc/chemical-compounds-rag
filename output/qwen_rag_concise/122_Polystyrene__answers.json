    {
      "question": "Describe the process of polymerization of styrene to form polystyrene and the role of polymerization initiators in this process.",
      "answer": "Styrene undergoes polymerization to form polystyrene through a free-radical chain reaction. Polymerization initiators, such as peroxides or heat, start the reaction by generating free radicals. These radicals then react with styrene monomers, initiating a chain reaction that continues until the polymer chains are sufficiently long and cross-linking due to initiator decomposition. Initiators ensure a controlled rate of polymerization, preventing premature termination and ensuring a high molecular weight polymer.",
