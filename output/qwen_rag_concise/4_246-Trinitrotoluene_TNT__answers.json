      "question": "Explain why TNT is considered a relatively safe explosive to handle compared to other explosives.",
      "answer": "TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) is relatively safe to handle compared to other explosives because its explosions are relatively slow, making it easier to control and less likely to cause immediate catastrophic effects. However, it is still hazardous and can cause respiratory and skin irritation, anemia, and lung damage. Some individuals, especially those engaged in its manufacture or use, face higher risks due to potential long-term health effects.",

    {
      "question": "Discuss how TNT's solubility properties affect its applications and handling.",
      "answer": "TNT's solubility in water is low, which affects its handling and application. This low solubility in water prevents it from dissolving in water-based substances, making it less prone to mixing with water-based solutions. This property is crucial in its use as an explosive, as it ensures purity and effectiveness in ordnance. Handling TNT requires strict adherence to safety protocols, as its solubility properties influence its potential for accidental contamination.",
