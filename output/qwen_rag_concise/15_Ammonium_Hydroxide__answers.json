      "question": "Explain why ammonium hydroxide does not have a melting or boiling point.",
      "answer": "Ammonium hydroxide is a liquid compound that does not form a solid or gas because it dissociates into ions in solution and does not exist in a solid or gaseous state.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process of how ammonium hydroxide is prepared and discuss its stability.",
      "answer": "Ammonium hydroxide is typically prepared by mixing ammonia (NH3) with water (H2O). This process can be achieved by dissolving ammonia gas in water, resulting in a solution of ammonium hydroxide. Its stability is moderate; it decomposes into ammonia and water when heated or exposed to acids.",
