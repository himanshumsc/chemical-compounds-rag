      "question": "Why is carbon monoxide considered a toxic gas and what conditions lead to its formation?",
      "answer": "Carbon monoxide is toxic because it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing oxygen transport. Formation is due to incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels in poorly ventilated spaces, such as in automobiles, gas stoves, or fireplaces.",
