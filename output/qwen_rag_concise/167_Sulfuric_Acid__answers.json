      "question": "Explain the primary method used today for the industrial production of sulfuric acid and how it differs from the original method developed by John Roebuck.",
      "answer": "The primary method for industrial production of sulfuric acid today is the contact process, which involves reacting sulfur dioxide with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst, then dissolving the sulfur trioxide in water to form sulfuric acid. This contrasts with John Roebuck's original method, which used a series of reactions involving nitric acid, carbon dioxide, and dilute sulfuric acid to produce sulfuric acid.",

      "question": "Considering its properties and uses, discuss the significance of sulfuric acid in modern industry and any potential hazards associated with its use.",
      "answer": "Sulfuric acid is crucial in modern industry for its use in the production of fertilizers, polymers, and various chemical intermediates. It is also essential in the refining of petroleum, metal processing, and in battery production. Its high corrosivity makes it hazardous if not handled properly, potentially causing severe burns and respiratory issues.",
