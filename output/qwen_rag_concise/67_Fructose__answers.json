    {
      "question": "Explain the structural difference between fructose and sucrose.",
      "answer": "Fructose and sucrose are both disaccharides but differ in their chemical structure. Fructose is a monosaccharide with a higher degree of unsaturation, making it sweeter than sucrose. Sucrose is composed of a glucose and a fructose molecule, linked through a glycosidic bond. This bond is located between the anomeric carbon of fructose and the anomeric carbon of glucose, resulting in a linear arrangement of atoms.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the commercial production process of fructose.",
      "answer": "Fructose is produced from the fermentation of carbohydrates. This process involves fermenting sugarcane or beet juice with yeast to produce ethanol and fructose. After fermentation, the solution undergoes distillation to remove ethanol and concentrate fructose. The resulting syrup can be used directly or refined further to obtain pure fructose.",
