      "question": "Explain the process by which N,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide (DEET) repels insects and discuss its safety considerations.",
      "answer": "N,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide (DEET) repels insects by interfering with their sensory systems, particularly their olfactory and gustatory receptors. DEET is not absorbed by insect skin and prevents them from detecting the presence of food. Its safety considerations include limited toxicity to mammals, but it can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, and eye irritation. Prolonged use or concentrated solutions may require safety precautions.",
