      "question": "Explain the role of carbon dioxide in the carbonation of beverages and its effects on taste and preservation.",
      "answer": "Carbon dioxide is used in carbonation of beverages to produce carbonated drinks. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water, forming carbonic acid, which gives carbonated beverages their characteristic fizz and effervescence. This carbonation enhances the taste by creating a pleasant, crisp texture. Carbonated beverages are preserved because the carbon dioxide forms a protective layer, preventing microbial growth, thus extending shelf life.",

      "question": "Describe the significance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and its properties.",
      "answer": "Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) is a state of carbon dioxide at temperatures and pressures above its critical point (31°C and 73 atm). It behaves as a dense liquid with high solvency, allowing it to dissolve solids and liquids. SC-CO2 is used as a green solvent in industrial processes due to its ability to extract substances without leaving behind residues, making it environmentally friendly and efficient.",
