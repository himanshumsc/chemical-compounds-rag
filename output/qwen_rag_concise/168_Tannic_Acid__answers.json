      "question": "Describe the physical state and properties of tannic acid.",
      "answer": "Tannic acid is a complex organic compound with a molecular formula C76H52O46. It is a polyphenol with a high molecular weight. Tannic acid exists as a powder at room temperature, with a bitter taste. It is sparingly soluble in water and has a light brown to dark brown color. Tannic acid is a weak acid, and its aqueous solutions show acidic properties, which are responsible for its astringent taste and antiseptic properties.",
