      "question": "Discuss the different types of collagen and their specific roles in the body.",
      "answer": "The human body contains different types of collagen, primarily type I, II, III, IV, and V. Type I collagen is abundant in skin, tendons, and bones, providing structural integrity and strength. Type II collagen is found in cartilage and joints, maintaining joint mobility and cushioning. Type III collagen is primarily in the skin, contributing to its elasticity. Type IV collagen forms the basement membrane, essential for tissue organization. Type V collagen helps in wound healing and skin regeneration.",
