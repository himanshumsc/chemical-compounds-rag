      "question": "Explain how sodium perborate is used in detergents and the chemical basis for its effectiveness as a bleaching agent.",
      "answer": "Sodium perborate is used in detergents as a bleaching agent due to its ability to rapidly generate hypochlorite ions (ClO-) upon contact with water. This process involves an acid-base reaction where sodium perborate (NaBO3) reacts with water (H2O) to form sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). Sodium hypochlorite is a strong oxidizing agent that can break down organic stains and bleach colored fabrics by oxidizing their molecular bonds. The effectiveness of sodium perborate as a bleaching agent in detergents is based on its ability to produce hypochlorite ions, which enhance the stain-removal and whitening properties of the detergent.",
