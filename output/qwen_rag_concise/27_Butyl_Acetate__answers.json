      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows butyl acetate (CH3CON(C2H5)O). It's a solvent used in lacquers, paints, and coatings. It's highly soluble in organic solvents, slightly soluble in water, and has a melting point of 169-172°C.",

      "question": "Explain the concept of isomers in the context of butyl acetate and list its three isomeric forms.",
      "answer": "Isomers are compounds that share the same molecular formula but differ in structure and therefore in their properties. Butyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5) has three isomeric forms: 2-methyl-2-propanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, and 2-methylbutanoic acid.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial production process for butyl acetate and its primary uses.",
      "answer": "Butyl acetate is produced by the reaction of butanol with acetic acid in the presence of a catalyst. It is primarily used in the manufacture of coatings, adhesives, and as a solvent for synthetic resins.",
