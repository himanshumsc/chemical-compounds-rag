      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown is Sodium Polyacrylate. It forms a mesh-like web due to cross-linking of polymer chains and expands when water is added, increasing its volume.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the solubility behavior of Sodium Polyacrylate in water.",
      "answer": "Sodium polyacrylate is highly soluble in water. This polymer is composed of repeating units of acrylate and sodium ions, which readily dissociate into ions in polar solvents like water, making it highly soluble.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process by which Sodium Polyacrylate is synthesized.",
      "answer": "Sodium polyacrylate is synthesized by polymerizing acrylate monomers in the presence of a catalyst and sodium ions. The process involves subjecting acrylate monomers to a controlled polymerization reaction, where the acrylate monomers are linked together to form a long polymer chain. Sodium ions are added to the reaction to create the sodium salt form of the polyacrylate, which enhances its water-binding properties.",
