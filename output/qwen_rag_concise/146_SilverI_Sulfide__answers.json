      "question": "Describe the primary uses and potential hazards associated with Silver(I) Sulfide.",
      "answer": "Silver(I) Sulfide is primarily used in the production of photographic materials, particularly in the formation of silver halide salts used in film and paper photography. It is also used in the manufacturing of glass and ceramic materials due to its optical properties. However, the compound is highly toxic and can cause severe respiratory irritation, skin burns, and eye damage if inhaled or exposed to skin or eyes. It is classified as a carcinogen, and exposure may lead to cancer. Handling should be carried out in a well-ventilated area, and protective gear should be worn.",
