      "question": "Explain the different hydrated forms of Magnesium Sulfate and their natural occurrences.",
      "answer": "Magnesium sulfate has several hydrated forms, including Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (Epsom salt) and Magnesium sulfate octahydrate. Epsom salt naturally occurs in hot springs and is used in baths to relieve muscle pain. Magnesium sulfate octahydrate is found in some geological formations and is used in various industrial processes.",

      "question": "Discuss the commercial and industrial applications of Magnesium Sulfate and its significance.",
      "answer": "Magnesium Sulfate is primarily used in the textile industry as a mordant, enhancing dye uptake and colorfastness. It is also used in agriculture as a fertilizer source for magnesium and sulfur, and in the production of magnesium metal through electrolysis. Additionally, it is used in the manufacturing of plaster, paper, and cosmetics. Its significance lies in its role in stabilizing pH levels and improving soil structure in agriculture.",
