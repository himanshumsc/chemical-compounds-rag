      "question": "Explain the industrial methods used to produce ethylene oxide and the main differences between them.",
      "answer": "Ethylene oxide is produced industrially through two main methods: the thionyl chloride method and the peroxybenzoic acid method. The thionyl chloride method involves reacting ethylene with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) in the presence of a catalyst, typically copper or iron, to form ethylene oxide and sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2). The peroxybenzoic acid method uses peroxybenzoic acid (C6H5CO3OH) to oxidize ethylene to ethylene oxide. Key differences include the reaction conditions, catalysts used, and by-products formed.",

      "question": "Discuss the primary industrial uses of ethylene oxide and the potential hazards associated with its handling.",
      "answer": "Ethylene oxide is primarily used in the production of ethylene glycol and other chemicals. It is also used in the synthesis of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), a copolymer. Handling ethylene oxide can expose workers to risks such as skin irritation, respiratory issues, and potential carcinogenic effects.",
