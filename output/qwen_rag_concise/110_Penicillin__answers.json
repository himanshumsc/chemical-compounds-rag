      "question": "How do penicillins function as antibiotics according to the provided compound information?",
      "answer": "Penicillins function as antibiotics by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. They bind to enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins, which are essential for the cross-linking of amino acids in the cell wall. This prevents the formation of a strong cell wall, leading to cell lysis and bacterial death.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the process of producing biosynthetic and semi-synthetic penicillins as mentioned in the compound information.",
      "answer": "Penicillin synthesis involves biotechnological processes where bacteria such as Penicillium chrysogenum are used to produce the antibiotic. Semi-synthetic penicillins are derived from the natural penicillin G and modified to enhance stability and effectiveness. For example, methicillin is a semi-synthetic penicillin that was developed to resist methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).",
