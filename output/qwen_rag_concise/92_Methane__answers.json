      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows methane (CH₄). It is a hydrocarbon, non-toxic, and has a molecular weight of 16. It is used as a fuel and as a raw material in chemical synthesis.",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility properties of methane and its density relative to air.",
      "answer": "Methane is highly soluble in water but poorly soluble in organic solvents like acetone. Its density is 0.714 g/L, which is less than that of air (1.225 g/L at STP).",

    {
      "question": "Explain how methane is formed and how it is found in nature.",
      "answer": "Methane is formed through the process of anaerobic decomposition of organic materials, such as vegetation and animal waste, in environments isolated from oxygen. In nature, it is primarily found in areas where organic matter breaks down without oxygen, such as in wetlands, landfill sites, and the digestive systems of animals. Methane is also produced by the bacteria that ferment organic matter.",
