      "question": "Describe the process of how Iron(III) oxide is reduced to iron metal in a blast furnace.",
      "answer": "Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is reduced to iron (Fe) in a blast furnace using a reducing agent such as carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon monoxide is produced in the furnace from carbon and oxygen. Iron(III) oxide reacts with carbon, producing iron and carbon dioxide. The reaction is: Fe2O3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO2. Carbon monoxide reduces the iron(III) oxide, resulting in the formation of iron metal and carbon dioxide gas.",
