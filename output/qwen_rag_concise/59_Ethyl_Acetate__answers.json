      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of Ethyl Acetate and its implications for industrial use.",
      "answer": "Ethyl acetate is highly soluble in organic solvents like ether and alcohol, making it suitable for industrial applications where it is often used as a solvent in paints and coatings, adhesives, and as a component in various chemical reactions. Its solubility in organic solvents, especially acetone and ether, is crucial for its use in many industrial processes requiring solvents.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the synthetic production process of Ethyl Acetate and its natural occurrence.",
      "answer": "Ethyl acetate is produced by reacting ethanol (C2H5OH) with acetic acid (CH3COOH). This process typically occurs in the presence of a catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, to promote the esterification reaction. Ethyl acetate is also found in nature, especially in fruits, where it contributes to their flavor and aroma.",
