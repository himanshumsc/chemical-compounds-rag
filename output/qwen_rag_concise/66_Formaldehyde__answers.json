      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows formaldehyde (H2CO). It's made by oxidizing methanol or gases from petroleum over a catalyst. Key uses include polymer production.",

      "question": "Why is formaldehyde typically provided as a 37 percent solution with added methanol?",
      "answer": "Formaldehyde is typically provided as a 37% solution with added methanol to stabilize the solution and prevent decomposition, as formaldehyde is highly reactive and unstable. Methanol acts as a stabilizer, preventing formaldehyde from polymerizing.",

      "question": "Describe the process by which formaldehyde is commercially produced and explain why natural atmospheric formaldehyde is not used for industrial purposes.",
      "answer": "Formaldehyde is produced industrially by oxidizing methanol (CH3OH) to form formic acid (HCOOH) and then further oxidizing it to formaldehyde. Natural atmospheric formaldehyde is typically produced from decomposition of carbohydrates and is too dilute and unstable for industrial use.",
