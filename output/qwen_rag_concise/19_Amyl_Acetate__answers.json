      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows Amyl acetate (C5H11CO2). It has a banana-like odor, used as a flavoring agent, and is produced from acetic acid and amyl alcohol with sulfuric acid as a catalyst.",

      "question": "Describe the process by which Amyl Acetate is industrially produced.",
      "answer": "Amyl acetate is industrially produced by reacting 2-butanone with acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction produces 2-butanone as a byproduct.",

      "question": "Explain why different isomers of Amyl Acetate have varying boiling points and provide their values.",
      "answer": "Different isomers of Amyl Acetate have varying boiling points due to differences in their molecular structure and interactions. The boiling point of straight-chain isomers is generally lower than that of branched-chain isomers, as the latter have more exposed hydrogens for intermolecular interactions. For Amyl Acetate, the boiling point of straight-chain (n-amyl acetate) is approximately 115°C, while branched-chain isomers have slightly higher boiling points.",
