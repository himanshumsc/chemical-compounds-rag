      "question": "Describe the solubility characteristics of Silver Nitrate and its behavior in the presence of light.",
      "answer": "Silver Nitrate is highly soluble in water, forming a clear solution. It does not absorb light and remains stable in most environments. When exposed to light, it can decompose, releasing oxygen and forming silver nitrite, which is less soluble and can lead to precipitation.",
