      "question": "Explain why calcium hydroxide often becomes contaminated and how can this be prevented.",
      "answer": "Calcium hydroxide often becomes contaminated due to its high solubility in water, which allows impurities to dissolve into the solution. Prevention involves storing calcium hydroxide in a dry environment and handling it carefully to avoid contamination from other materials.",

      "question": "Describe the role of calcium hydroxide in neutralizing acidic soils and the chemical process involved.",
      "answer": "Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) neutralizes acidic soils by reacting with acidic substances, such as H2SO4, to form salts like CaSO4 and water. This process reduces acidity in the soil, enhancing its fertility and promoting plant growth.",
