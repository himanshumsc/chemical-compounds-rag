      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows sulfur dioxide (SO2). It is a toxic gas used in bleaching and chemical production. It reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide.",

      "question": "Describe the dual role of sulfur dioxide as an oxidizing and reducing agent.",
      "answer": "Sulfur dioxide acts as an oxidizing agent by combining with oxygen or removing hydrogen. It also functions as a reducing agent by donating electrons.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the process and significance of capturing sulfur dioxide as a byproduct during the smelting of metallic ores.",
      "answer": "During smelting, metallic ores are heated in the presence of air or oxygen, producing sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a byproduct due to the oxidation of sulfur in the ore. This SO2 is captured to prevent air pollution and reduce environmental impact. It is typically absorbed in water to form sulfurous acid, which can be further processed to produce sulfuric acid, a valuable commodity used in various industries.",
