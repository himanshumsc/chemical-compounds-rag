      "question": "How does riboflavin interact with light and what is its stability under different conditions?",
      "answer": "Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a water-soluble vitamin that interacts with light by undergoing chemical reactions, especially when exposed to ultraviolet light. It can decompose into other compounds. Riboflavin is stable in dark conditions but may lose its potency when exposed to light or oxidants. Stability is enhanced by storing in dark containers and at low temperatures.",

      "question": "Describe the synthesis process of riboflavin using Bacillus subtilis or Ashbya gossifyii.",
      "answer": "Riboflavin synthesis using Bacillus subtilis or Ashbya gossyfiii involves microbial fermentation. These bacteria are used to produce riboflavin, a water-soluble vitamin (B2). The process typically begins with a solid-state fermentation, where the bacteria grow on a substrate rich in nitrogen and carbon sources. After a certain period, the fermentation broth is collected, and riboflavin is extracted and purified. This method is efficient and allows for large-scale production of riboflavin, essential for various industrial applications.",
