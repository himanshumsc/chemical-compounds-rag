      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows toluene. It is a hydrocarbon with a benzene ring and one methyl group. It occurs naturally in petroleum and is a solvent for other hydrocarbons.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the process by which toluene is extracted from petroleum.",
      "answer": "Toluene is extracted from petroleum through fractional distillation, a process where petroleum is heated to separate its components by boiling point. Lighter fractions with lower boiling points evaporate first, while heavier fractions with higher boiling points remain behind. The toluene, with a boiling point of 110.6°C, is isolated in the fraction between benzene (98.2°C) and xylene (138°C).",

      "question": "What are the major industrial applications of toluene and its role in the production of other chemicals?",
      "answer": "Toluene is primarily used as a solvent in the chemical industry, particularly in the production of paints, coatings, and adhesives. It is also used in the synthesis of nitrotoluene derivatives, which are intermediates for pesticides, dyes, and explosives. As a precursor to benzene, toluene is involved in the production of polystyrene and other polymers.",
