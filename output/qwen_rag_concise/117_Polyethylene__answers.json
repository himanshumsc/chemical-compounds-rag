      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows polyethylene, with white atoms representing hydrogen and black atoms representing carbon. It is a high-density polymer with excellent chemical resistance, durability, and low density.",

    {
      "question": "How does the structure of polyethylene affect its density, particularly in high-density versus low-density forms?",
      "answer": "High-density polyethylene (HDPE) has a higher density due to its more compact molecular structure, allowing for more efficient packing of atoms. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), with a less compact structure, has a lower density.",

      "question": "Given that polyethylene is a thermosetting polymer, explain why it cannot be re-melted once formed and how this property influences its applications.",
      "answer": "Polyethylene is a thermosetting polymer, meaning it undergoes a chemical reaction that makes it inflexible and unable to be re-melted once formed. This property influences its applications by making it suitable for durable products like plastic pipes, automotive parts, and containers, where re-melting is not required.",
