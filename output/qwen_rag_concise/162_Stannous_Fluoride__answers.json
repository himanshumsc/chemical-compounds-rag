    {
      "question": "Why is stannous fluoride considered more effective in preventing cavities compared to other fluoride compounds?",
      "answer": "Stannous Fluoride is considered more effective in preventing cavities because it forms more stable fluorapatite on tooth surfaces, providing better remineralization and longer-lasting cavity prevention compared to other fluoride compounds.",

      "question": "Explain the dual mechanism by which stannous fluoride helps in preventing tooth decay.",
      "answer": "Stannous fluoride prevents tooth decay by inhibiting bacterial activity that causes plaque formation, thus reducing acid production and erosion of tooth enamel. It also helps remineralize tooth enamel, strengthening it against acid attack.",
