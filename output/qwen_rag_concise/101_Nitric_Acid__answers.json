      "question": "Explain why nitric acid is considered a strong oxidizing agent and describe its reaction with metals.",
      "answer": "Nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent because it readily removes electrons from other molecules, acting as an oxidizing agent. When nitric acid reacts with metals, it oxidizes the metal, often forming a salt, while reducing itself to nitrogen oxides.",
