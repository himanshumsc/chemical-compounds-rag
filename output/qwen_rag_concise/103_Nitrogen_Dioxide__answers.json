      "question": "Explain how nitrogen dioxide is produced naturally and through human activities.",
      "answer": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is produced naturally through lightning strikes, volcanic eruptions, and bacterial decomposition. It is also formed through human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicle emissions. In these processes, NO2 is a byproduct of nitrogen and oxygen reacting at high temperatures.",

      "question": "Describe the uses of nitrogen dioxide in industrial applications and the associated safety hazards.",
      "answer": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is used in the production of nitric acid, which is then used in the manufacture of fertilizers, explosives, and other chemical products. It is also used in the production of vinyl chloride monomer and vinyl chloride. NO2 is toxic and can cause respiratory irritation, bronchial constriction, and lung tissue damage. Exposure can lead to asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory problems. Handling it requires protective gear such as respiratory masks and gloves.",
