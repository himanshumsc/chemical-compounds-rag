      "question": "Explain how sodium hypochlorite functions as a bleaching agent and disinfectant.",
      "answer": "Sodium hypochlorite acts as a bleaching agent by oxidizing organic compounds, thereby lightening the color of materials. It functions as a disinfectant by releasing hypochlorous acid, which breaks down bacterial and viral proteins, rendering them inactive.",

      "question": "Describe the commercial production process of sodium hypochlorite and outline its potential hazards.",
      "answer": "Sodium hypochlorite is produced by chlorinating a solution of sodium hydroxide. Chlorine gas is passed through a solution of sodium hydroxide, resulting in the formation of sodium hypochlorite. Potential hazards include irritation of the respiratory system, skin, and eyes, and can be corrosive. Handling should be done with appropriate safety precautions.",
