      "question": "Why is polypropylene considered a thermoplastic polymer, and how does this property affect its usability?",
      "answer": "Polypropylene is a thermoplastic polymer, meaning it softens and flows when heated, allowing for molding and shaping. This property makes it highly versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications in manufacturing and construction due to its ease of manipulation and recyclability.",
