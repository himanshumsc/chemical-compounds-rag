      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows amyl nitrite. Key properties: used in medicine for pain relief due to angina; converts to methemoglobin in the body to bind hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide, reducing their toxicity.",

      "question": "Why is isoamyl nitrite considered unstable, and what are its effects when used medically?",
      "answer": "Isoamyl nitrite is considered unstable due to its tendency to decompose into products that can cause severe side effects. When used medically, it can lead to hypotension, bradycardia, and vasodilatation, potentially resulting in severe hypotension and myocardial infarction.",

      "question": "Describe the synthesis method of isoamyl nitrite, and explain its use in emergency medical situations.",
      "answer": "Isoamyl nitrite is synthesized by the nitrosation of isoamyl alcohol. The resulting compound is used in emergency medical situations to treat certain types of angina, such as that caused by coronary artery spasm. It dilates coronary arteries and increases myocardial blood flow.",
