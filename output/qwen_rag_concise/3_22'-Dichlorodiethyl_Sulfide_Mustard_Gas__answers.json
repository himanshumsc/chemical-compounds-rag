      "question": "Explain why 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide is referred to as 'mustard gas' despite being a liquid at room temperature.",
      "answer": "2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide, known as mustard gas, was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I due to its high toxicity and ability to cause severe blisters and burns on the skin and eyes. Despite being a liquid at room temperature, it was dispersed as a fine spray or mist to maximize its effect. Its chemical properties, including its high reactivity with skin and eyes, led to its dangerous use, earning it the nickname 'mustard gas.'",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility characteristics of 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide and its implications for its use as a chemical agent.",
      "answer": "2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide is soluble in organic solvents but难溶于水。其化学性质使其在空气中不稳定，易分解为二氯乙烷和二氧化硫。因此，它不宜在水中使用，易挥发，且有毒，可能引起恶心、呕吐、昏迷等症状。",
