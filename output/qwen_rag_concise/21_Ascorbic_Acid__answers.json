      "question": "Explain why Ascorbic Acid is considered an essential vitamin for humans.",
      "answer": "Ascorbic acid, also known as Vitamin C, is essential for humans because it prevents scurvy, a disease characterized by bleeding gums, loose teeth, and poor wound healing. Vitamin C is involved in the synthesis of collagen, an essential protein for skin, blood vessel, and bone integrity. It also acts as a potent antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. Vitamin C deficiency leads to weakened immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. It is also required for the proper function of iron metabolism and the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter.",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility properties of Ascorbic Acid and the implications for its storage and consumption.",
      "answer": "Ascorbic Acid is highly water-soluble, dissolving easily in water. This property affects its storage by requiring refrigeration to prevent oxidation and degradation. In consumption, excessive intake can lead to diarrhea, while deficiency causes scurvy.",
