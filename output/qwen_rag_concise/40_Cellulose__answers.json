      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows cellulose. Key properties:\n- First discovered in 1819 by Henri Braconnot.\n- Red atoms are oxygen; white atoms are hydrogen; black atoms are carbon.\n- Insoluble in water; soluble in alcohol, ether, acetone, oils, and most organic solvents.\n- Used as a pain reliever, food additive, and in construction materials.",

      "question": "Describe the solubility properties of cellulose and explain why it behaves that way.",
      "answer": "Cellulose is an organic compound composed of glucose units and is highly polar due to its numerous hydroxyl groups. It is insoluble in water and other common organic solvents such as alcohol and acetone. Cellulose's solubility properties are due to its strong hydrogen bonding, which prevents it from dissolving in polar solvents. However, cellulose can be partially soluble in certain organic solvents that can disrupt hydrogen bonding, like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF).",

      "question": "Cellulose is described as providing structural support for plants. Discuss how its structure contributes to this function and compare its occurrence in various natural sources.",
      "answer": "Cellulose, a polymer of glucose units, contributes to plant structure by forming a rigid network. Its strong hydrogen bonds between adjacent glucose chains enhance rigidity. Cellulose is abundant in plant cell walls, providing structural support. It occurs in wood, paper, cotton, and other plant fibers.",
