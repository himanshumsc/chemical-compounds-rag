      "question": "How is Monosodium Glutamate produced commercially and what is the key process involved?",
      "answer": "Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is produced commercially through a fermentation process, where microorganisms convert glutamic acid into MSG. The key process involves culturing genetically modified microorganisms in a nutrient-rich medium, allowing them to metabolize and produce glutamic acid. The glutamic acid is then separated, purified, and combined with sodium to form MSG. This process is efficient and widely used in the food industry for seasoning and flavor enhancement.",

      "question": "What are the potential hazards of consuming Monosodium Glutamate, and how does its concentration affect its flavor-enhancing properties?",
      "answer": "Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) potential hazards include excitotoxicity, affecting brain function, causing symptoms like headaches, flushing, flushing, and allergic reactions. MSG's concentration affects its flavor-enhancing properties, with higher concentrations leading to more potent umami taste, enhancing savory flavors. However, excessive consumption can lead to adverse effects, particularly in individuals with a genetic predisposition to MSG sensitivity.",
