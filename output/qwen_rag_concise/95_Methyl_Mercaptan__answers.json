      "question": "Explain the primary use of Methyl Mercaptan and why it is important for safety in certain applications.",
      "answer": "Methyl mercaptan is used as a flame arrester in certain applications, particularly in the petrochemical industry, where it helps prevent the spread of fire by forming a foam that blankets the flame. This is important for safety as it prevents large-scale fires and reduces exposure to hazardous environments.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction process used to synthesize Methyl Mercaptan.",
      "answer": "Methyl mercaptan is synthesized by reacting methanol with hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction is as follows: CH₃OH + H₂S → CH₃SH + H₂O. This process is typically carried out in a liquid phase at high temperatures and pressures.",
