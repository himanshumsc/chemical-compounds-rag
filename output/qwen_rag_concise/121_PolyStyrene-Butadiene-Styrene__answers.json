      "question": "Explain the structure of Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) as a block copolymer and describe the roles of its segments.",
      "answer": "Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) is a block copolymer with repeating blocks of styrene (S) and butadiene (B). Its structure is S-S (S) B B B (B) S-S (S). The styrene segments (S-S) are hydrophilic and the butadiene segments (B) are hydrophobic. The hydrophilic segments are attracted to water, while the hydrophobic segments repel water. This structure allows the copolymer to form microphase-separated structures with a hydrophilic core surrounded by a hydrophobic shell, making it useful for applications where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties are required.",

      "question": "Describe the polymerization process and catalyst used in the production of Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene). Why is the reaction terminated, and how is it achieved?",
      "answer": "Poly(Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) is produced via polymerization of styrene and 1,3-butadiene. The process involves free-radical polymerization, where a catalyst like azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) initiates the reaction. The reaction is terminated by adding a radical scavenger, typically hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with free radicals to terminate chain growth.",
