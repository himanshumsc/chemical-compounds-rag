      "question": "Explain the significance of Methyl-t-butyl Ether's azeotropic mixture with water.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE) forms an azeotropic mixture with water. This mixture has a fixed boiling point and composition, enabling efficient separation. This property is crucial in refining processes, allowing for effective separation of hydrocarbons from water.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical context and environmental impact that led to the use of Methyl-t-butyl Ether as a gasoline additive.",
      "answer": "Methyl-t-butyl Ether (MTBE) was used in gasoline as an oxygenate to improve the octane rating, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. Its use was encouraged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce air pollution from vehicle emissions. However, MTBE was later found to leach into groundwater, posing health risks to humans. Due to these concerns, MTBE use has been phased out in many areas.",
