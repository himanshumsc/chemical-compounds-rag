      "question": "Explain why Polytetrafluoroethylene does not have a boiling point.",
      "answer": "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) does not have a boiling point because it undergoes a phase transition directly from solid to gas, called sublimation, above 328°C (622°F).",

      "question": "Discuss the solubility properties of Polytetrafluoroethylene and its implications for industrial applications.",
      "answer": "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is highly hydrophobic and hydrophobic-chlorophobic, making it difficult to dissolve in water but soluble in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform and dichloromethane. Its low surface energy and lack of polar groups result in excellent resistance to most chemicals and solvents, making it ideal for various industrial applications, including lubrication, coatings, and sealants.",
