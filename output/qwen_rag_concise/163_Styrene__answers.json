      "question": "Explain the process of polymerization as it relates to styrene and identify the type of compounds formed as a result.",
      "answer": "Polymerization of styrene involves the addition of monomeric styrene molecules to form a long polymer chain. This process, known as addition polymerization, results in the formation of styrene polymers, which are crosslinked or linear polymers depending on the reaction conditions. The resulting compound is a synthetic polymer with high molecular weight.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial preparation method for styrene, including the chemical reaction and conditions involved.",
      "answer": "Styrene is produced industrially by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of a catalyst under high temperatures (1000-1200 °C) and pressures (10-15 atm). The reaction involves the removal of hydrogen from ethylbenzene to form styrene and ethylene.",
