      "question": "Explain how ethylbenzene is synthesized synthetically and identify the catalyst used in the reaction.",
      "answer": "Ethylbenzene is synthesized by the alkylation of benzene with ethyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The reaction occurs at room temperature, producing a mixture of ethylbenzene and ethyltoluenes.",
