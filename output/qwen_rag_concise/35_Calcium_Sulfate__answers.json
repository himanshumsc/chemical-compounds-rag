      "question": "Explain the difference between the anhydrous and hydrated forms of calcium sulfate.",
      "answer": "Calcium sulfate exists in two forms: anhydrous and hydrated. Anhydrous calcium sulfate is pure calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and is a white, crystalline solid. It is highly soluble in water and is often used in gypsum board production. Hydrated calcium sulfate, or gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O), is the most common form used in construction, particularly in plaster and cement. It is much less soluble in water and forms when anhydrous calcium sulfate reacts with water.",

    {
      "question": "Given its solubility characteristics, why might anhydrous calcium sulfate be used in industrial applications?",
      "answer": "Anhydrous calcium sulfate is used in industrial applications due to its high solubility in water, which aids in the formation of gypsum and other calcium compounds used in building materials, paper production, and water treatment.",
