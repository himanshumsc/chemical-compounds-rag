      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows Zinc oxide (ZnO). Key properties: absorbs UV light (sunscreen), used in paints and pigments, prevents decomposition in rubber/plastics.",

      "question": "How does zinc oxide contribute to the longevity of white paints and pigments compared to other white paint compounds?",
      "answer": "Zinc oxide acts as a light stabilizer, absorbing ultraviolet light, which prevents the decomposition of pigments and the yellowing of white paints, thus enhancing their longevity compared to other white paint compounds.",

      "question": "Explain the process and chemical reactions involved in the 'wet' method of producing zinc oxide.",
      "answer": "The wet method for producing zinc oxide typically involves the precipitation of zinc ions from an aqueous solution. Zinc sulfate is often used as the starting material. The zinc sulfate solution is reacted with a base (e.g., sodium hydroxide) to produce zinc hydroxide precipitate. This precipitate is then filtered, washed, and calcined to remove water and transform zinc hydroxide to zinc oxide. The overall process involves chemical reactions such as precipitation and dehydration.",
