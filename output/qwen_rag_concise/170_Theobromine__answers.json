      "question": "How does theobromine affect the body differently than caffeine?",
      "answer": "Theobromine, similar to caffeine, stimulates the central nervous system, increasing alertness and mental performance. However, theobromine is less potent and has a slower onset of action. It also has a lower potential for caffeine-related side effects like jitteriness and anxiety. Theobromine has mild diuretic properties and can cause mild gastrointestinal upset. It is often found in chocolate and has a lower stimulant effect compared to caffeine.",

      "question": "Explain the process by which theobromine is typically extracted from cocoa bean hulls.",
      "answer": "Theobromine is typically extracted from cocoa bean hulls through a process involving physical separation and extraction. First, the cocoa bean hulls are removed from the cocoa beans. Then, the hulls are ground into a fine powder and soaked in hot water to extract the theobromine. The resulting mixture is filtered to separate the theobromine from the other compounds. The filtered theobromine is then purified and crystallized.",
