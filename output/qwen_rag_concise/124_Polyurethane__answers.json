      "question": "How are polyurethanes formed at the molecular level?",
      "answer": "Polyurethanes form by reacting isocyanates (-CO-N=C=O) with polyols (-OH). This reaction involves the addition of water to form urethane (-O-C-NH-COOH) groups, resulting in a polymer with a soft segment (-O-C-NH-) and a hard segment (-COO-).",

      "question": "Discuss the different forms of polyurethane and their respective properties and applications.",
      "answer": "Polyurethane comes in various forms, each with distinct properties and applications:\n\n1. **Flexible Polyurethane**: Soft and elastic, used in foams for comfort (e.g., cushions, mattresses), and in adhesives.\n2. **Rigid Polyurethane**: Stiff and hard, used in insulation panels and as a binder in paints.\n3. **High-Performance Polyurethane**: Developed for aerospace and automotive parts, offering high strength and durability.\n4. **Polyurethane Paint**: Provides a tough, durable coating used for construction and maintenance.\n5. **Polyurethane Foams**: Versatile, used in packaging, construction, and insulation.\n\nThese forms cater to specific needs and ensure durability in various applications.",
