      "question": "Explain the significance of caffeine's melting and sublimation points and how these properties might affect its practical use.",
      "answer": "Caffeine's melting point is approximately 232°C, and its sublimation point is around 190°C. These high temperatures imply that caffeine is not easily melted or sublimated, which might affect its practical use in products like chewing gum or tablets, as it requires significant heat to be incorporated into other materials.",
