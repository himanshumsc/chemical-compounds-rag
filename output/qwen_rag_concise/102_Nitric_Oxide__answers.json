      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows Nitric oxide (NO). It's a gas with a molecular weight of 30.01 g/mol. It's formed when nitrogen and oxygen combine under lightning or high temperatures. It's a pollutant in the atmosphere and a key component in acid rain formation.",

      "question": "Explain how nitric oxide is formed in the atmosphere and its role in pollution.",
      "answer": "Nitric oxide is formed in the atmosphere primarily through the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen in the air. It is also produced by industrial processes and vehicles, contributing to air pollution. Nitric oxide reacts with ozone in the presence of sunlight to form nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog. It can also react with hydrocarbons to form peroxyacetyl nitrates, a form of atmospheric pollution.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial uses of nitric oxide and its potential hazards.",
      "answer": "Nitric oxide has limited industrial use and is mainly produced for other purposes. Its production and use involve significant hazards such as respiratory issues, skin irritation, anemia, and lung damage. It is classified as a carcinogen.",
