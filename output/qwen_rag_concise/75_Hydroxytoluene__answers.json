      "question": "How do BHA and BHT function as food preservatives?",
      "answer": "BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene) are antioxidants used in foods to prevent oxidation and spoilage, thus extending shelf life. They inhibit the action of free radicals that can cause food to turn rancid or develop off-flavors.",

      "question": "Describe the process of synthesizing BHA and BHT, including the reactants and conditions required.",
      "answer": "BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) are synthesized from butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene, respectively. They are typically produced through the reaction of a peroxy acid with anisole or toluene in the presence of a catalyst and under controlled temperature conditions.",
