      "question": "Explain how aluminum hydroxide is used in medical applications and describe its effectiveness.",
      "answer": "Aluminum hydroxide is used in medical applications primarily as an antacid to treat symptoms of acid indigestion and other gastrointestinal issues. It neutralizes stomach acids, reducing symptoms like heartburn, acid reflux, and nausea. It is commonly found in over-the-counter medications such as Maalox, Mylanta, and Gelusil. It is also used in antiperspirants and deodorants as aluminum hydroxychloride.",
