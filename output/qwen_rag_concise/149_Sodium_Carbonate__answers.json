      "question": "Discuss the significance of sodium carbonate's hygroscopic nature and its implications for storage.",
      "answer": "Sodium carbonate is highly hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air. This property is significant because it can cause the compound to lose its crystalline structure and become an amorphous powder if stored improperly. To prevent this, sodium carbonate must be stored in a tightly closed container and kept in a dry environment to maintain its stability and effectiveness.",
