      "question": "Why is Naproxen classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and what are its primary uses?",
      "answer": "Naproxen is classified as an NSAID because it inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, similar to ibuprofen, reducing inflammation and pain. Its primary uses include treating pain and inflammation in conditions like menstrual cramps, arthritis, headaches, migraines, injuries, surgery, and discomfort from influenza and gout.",

      "question": "Describe the solubility characteristics of Naproxen and explain how these properties might influence its formulation as a pharmaceutical product.",
      "answer": "Naproxen is a derivative of ibuprofen with enhanced anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It is slightly soluble in water but highly soluble in organic solvents. These solubility characteristics influence its formulation by requiring the use of appropriate excipients and solvents to ensure proper dissolution and bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract.",
