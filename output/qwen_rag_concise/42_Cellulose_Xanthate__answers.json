      "question": "Explain how cellulose xanthate is transformed into rayon fibers during the viscose process.",
      "answer": "Cellulose xanthate is transformed into rayon fibers during the viscose process by first dissolving cellulose xanthate in a basic solution to form a viscous dope. Sodium hydroxide is added to increase the basicity. The dope is then spun through a spinneret, extruding it into a bath of dilute sulfuric acid, counteracting the basicity. The xanthate groups are hydrolyzed to form hydroxyl groups, producing cellulose. The resulting fibers are washed, dried, and heat-set to form rayon.",

      "question": "What are some advantages and disadvantages of using rayon, and what legislative measure was introduced in response to one of its disadvantages?",
      "answer": "Rayon is an artificial fiber produced from wood pulp. Advantages: Cost-effective, soft, and easily produced. Disadvantages: Can cause allergic reactions, and requires harsh chemicals in production. The Fiber Quality and Labeling Act of 1970 aimed to regulate the use of rayon.",
