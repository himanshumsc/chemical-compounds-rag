      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure diagram shows sucrose octaooleate. It has many properties of fat, including its flavor, but passes through the digestive system without being absorbed or digested.",

      "question": "Why is sucrose polyester considered to provide no calories when consumed?",
      "answer": "Sucrose polyester is a synthetic polymer that mimics the structure of sucrose but lacks the ability to be metabolized by the body, thus providing no calories.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical development and intended purpose of sucrose polyester.",
      "answer": "Sucrose polyester, a synthetic polymer, was developed by blending sucrose with polyester monomers. Initially, its primary purpose was to provide a biodegradable alternative to traditional plastics. Over time, it found use in biomedical materials, such as scaffolding for tissue engineering, due to its biocompatibility and ability to degrade into natural compounds.",
