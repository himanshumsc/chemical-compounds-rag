      "question": "Why was 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, also known as ibuprofen, developed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication?",
      "answer": "2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, developed as ibuprofen, was created by Boots Company researchers in the early 1960s. They found that carboxylic acids, similar to aspirin, have anti-inflammatory properties and ibuprofen met this criterion. It is twice as effective as aspirin, making it an effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication.",

      "question": "Given that 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point, what implications does this have for its storage and use in pharmaceutical applications?",
      "answer": "2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid decomposes above its melting point, indicating it must be stored below its melting point to prevent decomposition. This limits its use in pharmaceutical applications to cold storage, ensuring stability and efficacy.",
