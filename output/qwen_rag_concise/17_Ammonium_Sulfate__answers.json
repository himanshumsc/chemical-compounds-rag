      "question": "Explain why ammonium sulfate is primarily used in fertilizers.",
      "answer": "Ammonium sulfate is primarily used in fertilizers because it is a soluble source of nitrogen, an essential nutrient for plant growth. It provides plants with nitrogen, which is crucial for chlorophyll production, photosynthesis, and overall growth.",

      "question": "Describe how ammonium sulfate is produced using gypsum, ammonia, and carbon dioxide.",
      "answer": "Ammonium sulfate is produced by reacting gypsum (calcium sulfate) with ammonia (NH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The reaction involves the conversion of calcium sulfate to gypsum and the formation of ammonium sulfate (NH₄₂SO₄) as a byproduct.",
