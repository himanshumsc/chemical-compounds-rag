      "question": "Explain the process of how phosphoric acid is commercially produced starting from phosphate rock.",
      "answer": "Phosphate rock is first crushed and heated in a kiln to produce phosphate oxide. This oxide is then mixed with sulfuric acid and heated to form phosphoric acid. Finally, the phosphoric acid is purified by distillation to remove impurities.",
