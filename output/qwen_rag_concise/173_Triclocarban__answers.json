      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The molecular structure shown is Triclocarban. It contains carbon (black), hydrogen (white), nitrogen (blue), and chlorine (green). Triclocarban inhibits ENR, used by bacteria and fungi for cell membranes, making it harmless to humans.",

      "question": "Why is Triclocarban considered harmless to humans but effective as an antimicrobial agent against bacteria and fungi?",
      "answer": "Triclocarban is considered harmless to humans because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted in urine. However, it is effective against bacteria and fungi because it disrupts the cell membrane, preventing the absorption of nutrients necessary for growth and reproduction.",

      "question": "Discuss the potential environmental and health concerns associated with the use of Triclocarban in antimicrobial products.",
      "answer": "Triclocarban is an antimicrobial agent with potential environmental impacts, including interference with thyroid hormone function in wildlife. It can also break down into more toxic substances like triclosan. Health concerns include skin irritation, allergic reactions, and potential links to antibiotic resistance.",
