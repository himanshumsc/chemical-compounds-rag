      "question": "Explain the process of how sodium acetate is prepared using sodium hydroxide and acetic acid.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is prepared by reacting sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with acetic acid (CH3COOH). The reaction produces sodium acetate (CH3COONa) as a salt. This process typically involves dissolving acetic acid in water, adding sodium hydroxide, and allowing the reaction to proceed, often requiring heating to drive the reaction to completion.",

      "question": "Discuss why sodium acetate is used in the textile industry and describe its physical properties that make it suitable for this application.",
      "answer": "Sodium acetate is used in the textile industry as a fabric softener and sizing agent due to its ability to form a thin film on fabric fibers, which enhances softness and reduces static. Its physical properties, such as solubility in water and organic solvents, make it suitable for application in textile treatments.",
