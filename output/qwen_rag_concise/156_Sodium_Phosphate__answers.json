      "question": "Explain how the different forms of sodium phosphate are produced from phosphoric acid.",
      "answer": "Sodium phosphate is produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The reaction yields an ionic compound consisting of sodium (Na+) and phosphate (PO4^3-) ions. Common forms include disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) and sodium tripolyphosphate (Na5P3O10).",
