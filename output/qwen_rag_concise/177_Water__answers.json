      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The diagram shows water (H2O). Key properties: high boiling point, hydrogen bonding leading to surface tension, excellent solvent due to its dipole character.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the dipole nature of water and its implications.",
      "answer": "Water (H2O) has a bent structure with a partial positive charge on hydrogen atoms and a partial negative charge on oxygen. This polarity arises due to the difference in electronegativity between hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The oxygen's electronegativity is higher, causing the electrons to be more attracted to the oxygen, thus creating a dipole moment. This dipole nature in water leads to hydrogen bonding, which influences its physical properties such as high surface tension, high boiling point, and high viscosity.",

      "question": "Describe a reaction involving water and a metal, and explain the safety considerations involved.",
      "answer": "Water reacts with metals like sodium (Na) or magnesium (Mg) to form metal hydroxides and hydrogen gas (H₂). Example: Na + 2H₂O → NaOH + H₂↑ + NaOH. Safety: Avoid direct skin contact; use gloves; keep away from eyes; handle small quantities; avoid inhaling vapor; wear protective clothing; dispose of waste properly.",
