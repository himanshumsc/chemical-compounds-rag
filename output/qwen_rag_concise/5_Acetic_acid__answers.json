      "question": "Describe the industrial method developed by Monsanto for producing acetic acid and mention an alternative method that is being researched for environmental benefits.",
      "answer": "The Monsanto method for producing acetic acid involves heating synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and H2) over a catalyst of copper metal mixed with zinc oxide to make methanol, then treating methanol with CO to form acetic acid. An alternative method being researched involves oxidizing industrial waste gases to acetic acid for more efficient and environmentally-friendly production.",
