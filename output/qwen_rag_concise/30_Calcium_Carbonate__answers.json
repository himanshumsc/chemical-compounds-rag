      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image shows the molecular structure of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). It has a molecular weight of 100 g/mol, is insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol, ether, acetone, and most organic solvents. Used in antacids and agricultural purposes.",

      "question": "Describe the solubility characteristics of calcium carbonate and how they affect its use in different environments.",
      "answer": "Calcium carbonate is slightly soluble in water and soluble in organic solvents like alcohol and acetone. This solubility affects its use in environments where it can dissolve in water, such as in rocks and soil, and in organic solvent-based applications.",

      "question": "Explain the process by which calcium carbonate can be synthesized in the laboratory and how its physical form might vary depending on its crystal structure.",
      "answer": "Calcium carbonate can be synthesized by neutralizing a solution of calcium chloride with a solution of sodium carbonate: CaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + 2NaCl. Its physical form varies based on crystal structure, commonly appearing as chalk, marble, oyster shell, or powder, with variations in density and hardness.",
