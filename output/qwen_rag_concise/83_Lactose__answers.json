      "question": "Describe the process of obtaining alpha-lactose monohydrate from lactose and why this form is commonly used.",
      "answer": "Alpha-lactose monohydrate is produced by heating lactose at high temperatures in the presence of water. This process reduces lactose to alpha-lactose monohydrate, a form that is more stable and commonly used due to its improved solubility and taste profile.",
