      "question": "Explain why the boiling point of Acetylsalicylic Acid is not applicable.",
      "answer": "Acetylsalicylic acid is not listed with a boiling point because it is not a liquid but a solid at room temperature. Its melting point is 16.6°C, indicating it transitions from solid to liquid at this temperature.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical significance of Acetylsalicylic Acid and its origins.",
      "answer": "Acetylsalicylic Acid (aspirin) was rediscovered in 1873 by Charles G. Gerhardt and re-synthesized in 1873. Its origins trace back to the 18th century when it was found in willow bark. Although its medicinal qualities were not appreciated for another 20 years, by 1949 it became the most popular analgesic sold in the world.",
