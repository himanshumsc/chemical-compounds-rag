    {
      "question": "Explain the process by which Silver Iodide is used in photography.",
      "answer": "Silver iodide is used in photography as a light-sensitive compound in emulsions or coatings on film. When exposed to light, silver iodide decomposes, releasing silver atoms, which then form silver particles on the film, creating a latent image. Developing the film with chemicals like sodium thiosulfate (hypo) neutralizes the remaining silver iodide and fixes the developed image. This process, known as the bromide or silver process, captures the latent image and makes it visible through chemical reactions.",

      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction used to synthesize Silver Iodide from silver nitrate and sodium iodide. Why is ruby red light used during this process?",
      "answer": "Silver iodide (AgI) is synthesized by combining silver nitrate (AgNO₃) and sodium iodide (NaI). The reaction occurs in solution as follows: Ag⁺ + I⁻ → AgI(s). Ruby red light is used to minimize light-induced degradation of AgI, which can be sensitive to light.",
