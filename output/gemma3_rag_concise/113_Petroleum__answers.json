      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **acetylene**. Key properties: derived from petroleum via cracking/oxidation, used in chemical manufacturing (vinyl chloride, etc.). It's represented with white atoms as hydrogen and black as carbon, with double bonds.",

      "question": "What are the primary components of petroleum, and how do they differ in terms of chemical bonding?",
      "answer": "Petroleum is primarily hydrocarbons (Source 4). These consist of carbon and hydrogen (Source 4) linked by ionic bonds (Source 2). Different hydrocarbons vary in their structural formulas, impacting properties.",

      "question": "Explain the refining process of petroleum and the significance of different temperature fractions in this process.",
      "answer": "Petroleum refining involves separating crude oil into fractions based on boiling points via distillation.\n\n**Temperature Fractions & Significance:**\n\n*   **Low Temp (Below 40°C):** Gases (methane, ethane) - Fuel, chemicals.\n*   **Mid Temp (40-200°C):** Gasoline (naphtha) - Fuel.\n*   **Mid-High Temp (200-350°C):** Kerosene/Jet Fuel - Aviation fuel.\n*   **High Temp (350-400°C):** Diesel/Heating Oil - Fuel.\n*   **Very High Temp (Above 400°C):** Lubricants, Asphalt.\n\nHydrocarbons with lower boiling points vaporize first, allowing for separation.",

      "question": "Discuss the environmental impact of petroleum extraction and usage, particularly focusing on its role in energy production and transportation.",
      "answer": "Petroleum (a fossil fuel – Source 2) is central to energy & transportation. Extraction causes habitat disruption, potential spills. Burning it releases greenhouse gases (Source 3), contributing to global warming (Source 2) and the greenhouse effect (Source 2). CFCs, once used in petroleum-related products (Source 3), damaged the ozone layer. While acetic acid production is mentioned, it’s not directly linked to the broader environmental impacts of petroleum itself.",
