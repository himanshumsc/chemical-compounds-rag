      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts nitric acid (HNO₃). It's a strong acid, important in industry, and produced via the Ostwald process (oxidation of ammonia). Key properties include its chemical reactivity and role in forming nitrogen compounds.",

      "question": "Explain why nitric acid is considered a strong oxidizing agent and describe its reaction with metals.",
      "answer": "Nitric acid (HNO₃) is a strong oxidizing agent due to its ability to readily donate oxygen and accept electrons. This property causes it to react vigorously with metals.\n\nReactions with metals typically involve the metal being oxidized (losing electrons) while nitric acid is reduced (gaining electrons). The products vary depending on the metal and concentration of nitric acid, yielding metal nitrates, water, and nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂, N₂O). For example, with iron: Fe + 6 HNO₃ → 3 Fe(NO₃)₂ + 2 H₂O.",
