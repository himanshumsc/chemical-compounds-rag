      "question": "How does dichlorodifluoromethane's solubility vary between water and other solvents like alcohol and ether?",
      "answer": "Dichlorodifluoromethane (a CFC) is **insoluble** in water. It exhibits **good solubility** in organic solvents like alcohol and ether.\n\n\n\nThis information isn't directly present in the provided text. However, based on general scientific knowledge related to CFCs, this is the accurate answer. The provided documents focus on Aluminum Fluoride and Aluminum Hydroxide.",

      "question": "Explain why dichlorodifluoromethane is categorized as both a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and an alkyl halide.",
      "answer": "I am unable to find information regarding dichlorodifluoromethane in the provided sources. However, I can explain why a compound can be both a CFC and an alkyl halide based on general chemical principles.\n\n**CFC Classification:** Dichlorodifluoromethane (if it existed within the provided data) would be a CFC due to containing both carbon, chlorine, and fluorine atoms. CFCs are specifically defined by this structure.\n\n**Alkyl Halide Classification:** It's an alkyl halide because it features an alkyl group (carbon chain) bonded to a halogen (chlorine and fluorine). \"Halo-\" refers to the halogen element.",
