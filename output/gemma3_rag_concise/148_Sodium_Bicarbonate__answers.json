      "question": "Why is sodium bicarbonate considered an acid salt and what happens to it when heated?",
      "answer": "Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) is considered an acid salt because it's a salt formed from a weak acid (carbonic acid) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide).\n\nWhen heated, sodium bicarbonate decomposes, releasing carbon dioxide gas (CO₂), water (H₂O), and leaving behind sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃). This is a common application in baking, where the CO₂ creates leavening.\n\nNaHCO₃ (s) → Na₂CO₃ (s) + H₂O (g) + CO₂ (g)",
