    {
      "question": "Explain how sodium perborate is used in detergents and the chemical basis for its effectiveness as a bleaching agent.",
      "answer": "Sodium perborate acts as a bleaching agent in detergents. It decomposes in water to release hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). The chemical basis for its bleaching action is the oxidizing power of H₂O₂ which breaks down colored stains, rendering them colorless. It's a relatively stable source of peroxide, releasing it gradually during the wash cycle.",
