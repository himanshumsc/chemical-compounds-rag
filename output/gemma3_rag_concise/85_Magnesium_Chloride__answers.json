      "question": "Explain the deliquescent property of Magnesium Chloride and its transformation into a hydrated form.",
      "answer": "Magnesium Chloride (MgCl₂) is hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air. Specifically, it exhibits deliquescence – it absorbs so much moisture that it dissolves in the absorbed water, forming a solution. This process leads to its transformation into a hydrated form, often represented as MgCl₂·nH₂O (where 'n' is the number of water molecules). Source 2 lists Magnesium Chloride with a molecular weight of 411, Magnesium Hydroxide 415, Magnesium Oxide 419, Magnesium Silicate Hydroxide 423, & Magnesium Sulfate 429 – indicating its presence in the database, but not explicitly detailing deliquescence.",
