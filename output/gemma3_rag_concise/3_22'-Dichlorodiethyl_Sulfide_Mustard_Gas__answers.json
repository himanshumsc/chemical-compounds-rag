      "question": "Explain why 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide is referred to as 'mustard gas' despite being a liquid at room temperature.",
      "answer": "The nickname \"mustard gas\" for 2,2'-Dichlorodiethyl Sulfide isn't due to its physical state. It earned the name during World War I due to its resemblance in odor and delayed effects to mustard and other pungent plants. Despite being a liquid, its vesicant (blister-causing) and lung-damaging properties led to the infamous moniker.",
