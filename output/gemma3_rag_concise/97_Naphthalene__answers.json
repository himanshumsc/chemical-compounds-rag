      "question": "Explain the significance of naphthalene being an aromatic hydrocarbon and discuss its structural composition.",
      "answer": "Naphthalene (not found in provided sources) is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Aromaticity signifies exceptional stability due to a delocalized pi electron system, giving it unique chemical properties. Structurally, it consists of two fused benzene rings. This fused ring system is responsible for its aromatic nature and characteristic properties.",
