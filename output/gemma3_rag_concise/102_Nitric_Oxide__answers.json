      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Nitric oxide (NO). It's formed from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures (2,000°C). It's an environmental pollutant that readily forms nitrogen dioxide, and is involved in the combustion of fuels.",

    {
      "question": "Explain how nitric oxide is formed in the atmosphere and its role in pollution.",
      "answer": "Nitric oxide (NO) forms in the atmosphere through high-temperature combustion processes, like those from vehicle engines and industrial activities. It's a pollutant contributing to smog and acid rain. NO reacts with other pollutants to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a harmful gas. NO also participates in ozone depletion and contributes to particulate matter formation, exacerbating air quality issues.",

      "question": "Describe the industrial uses of nitric oxide and its potential hazards.",
      "answer": "Nitric oxide (NO) isn't directly listed with industrial uses or hazards in the provided sources. However, the sources mention 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), a compound related to nitric acid. TNT's hazards include respiratory problems, skin irritation, anemia, and lung damage. It's potentially carcinogenic and primarily a concern for those involved in its manufacture or use.",
