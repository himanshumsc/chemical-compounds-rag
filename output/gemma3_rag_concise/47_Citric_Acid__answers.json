      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **citric acid**. It's central to the Krebs cycle, vital for energy production. It acts as an antioxidant, combating free radicals and potentially slowing aging. Discovered by Hans Krebs, it was historically linked to Jabir Ibn Hayyan.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula of citric acid and what elements does it consist of?",
      "answer": "The provided text does not contain information about citric acid. It focuses entirely on acetic acid.\n\n\n\nAcetic acid's formula is CH3COOH. It consists of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.",

      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of citric acid and what this implies about its interactions with different solvents.",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain information about citric acid's solubility. It details the solubility of acetic acid, indicating it's soluble in water, alcohol, ether, acetone, and benzene. This implies acetic acid readily interacts with polar and some nonpolar solvents due to its molecular structure.",

The documents focus on acetic acid, acetaminophen, carbohydrates, carcinogens, and other chemical compounds, but not citric acid. Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on the given context.",
