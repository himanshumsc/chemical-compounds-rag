      "question": "Explain why ammonium nitrate does not occur naturally and discuss its stability and decomposition characteristics.",
      "answer": "Ammonium nitrate doesn't occur naturally in significant quantities. It's a manufactured compound (Source 1). It's used in explosives like Amatol (Source 1) due to its combination with TNT. While generally stable, ammonium nitrate can decompose explosively under heat, shock, or confinement (implied by its use in explosives). Its stability depends on factors like purity and storage conditions.",
