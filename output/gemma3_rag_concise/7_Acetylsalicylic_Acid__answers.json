      "question": "Explain why the boiling point of Acetylsalicylic Acid is not applicable.",
      "answer": "The provided text does not explicitly state why the boiling point of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is not applicable. However, it focuses on aspirin's properties as a medicine (pain relief, inflammation reduction, fever reduction) and its formulation as tablets containing acetylsalicylic acid, water, starch, and a lubricant – highlighting its use as a drug form rather than a bulk chemical. Therefore, the boiling point isn't a relevant characteristic in this context.",

      "question": "Discuss the historical significance of Acetylsalicylic Acid and its origins.",
      "answer": "Acetylsalicylic Acid (aspirin) gained popularity and widespread use after 1949, becoming the most popular analgesic globally. However, the compound was re-discovered and synthesized in 1873. Its medicinal qualities weren't fully appreciated until 1949. Historically, it evolved from alchemy, a precursor to modern chemistry.",
