      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of Isoamyl Acetate and its implications for industrial uses.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly mention Isoamyl Acetate's solubility. However, Source 1 states that organic compounds generally dissolve well in organic solvents like acetone, ether, alcohol, and benzene. Given Isoamyl Acetate is an organic ester, it's likely soluble in these solvents.\n\nThis solubility is relevant to industrial uses (Source 5) as it facilitates its use in producing packaging materials, paints, adhesives, and artificial fibers. The ability to dissolve allows for reactions and formulations needed in these processes.",
