      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Potassium hydroxide (KOH). It's a strong base used in soaps, detergents, and various chemical processes. Produced by electrolysis of potassium chloride. Can be corrosive.",

      "question": "Why is Potassium Hydroxide considered a deliquescent material, and what happens when it absorbs carbon dioxide from the air?",
      "answer": "Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is deliquescent, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air. When it absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air, a chemical reaction occurs, forming potassium carbonate (K2CO3). This process effectively \"eats away\" the KOH.",

      "question": "Explain the process by which Potassium Hydroxide is manufactured and describe its reactivity with metals in moist air.",
      "answer": "Potassium hydroxide (KOH) isn't directly manufactured, but it's commonly produced by the electrolysis of potassium chloride (KCl) solutions.\n\nRegarding reactivity with metals in moist air, KOH is caustic. It reacts with certain metals (like aluminum) in moist air, forming a gelatinous precipitate of aluminum hydroxide, as demonstrated with NaOH in Source 4. This reaction highlights KOH's basic and corrosive nature.",
