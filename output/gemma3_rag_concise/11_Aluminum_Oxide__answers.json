      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃). It's a refractory material, a hard abrasive used for grinding, polishing, and scouring. Produced from aluminum hydroxide, it has a high melting point.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why Aluminum Oxide is suitable for use in abrasives and refractory products.",
      "answer": "Aluminum oxide’s suitability for abrasives and refractory products stems from its **hardness (corundum is second only to diamond)**, **high melting point (2072°C)**, and **resistance to attack by most solvents and chemical agents**. These properties make it ideal for abrasive applications and high-temperature refractory uses.",
