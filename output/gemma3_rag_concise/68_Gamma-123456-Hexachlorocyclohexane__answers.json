      "answer": "Gamma-1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH, or lindane) exhibits isomerism due to the different spatial arrangements of chlorine atoms around the cyclohexane ring. It exists as multiple stereoisomers, but the γ isomer is most significant.\n\nThe γ-isomer is commercially important because it possesses insecticidal properties and was widely used as an insecticide. However, due to environmental and health concerns, its use has been severely restricted or banned in many countries.",
