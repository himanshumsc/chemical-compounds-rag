      "question": "Describe a reaction involving water and a metal, and explain the safety considerations involved.",
      "answer": "Reactions between water and metals vary. Some metals (like sodium) react violently, producing hydrogen gas and heat. Others (like iron) react slowly, forming rust (iron oxide).\n\n**Safety:** All such reactions should be performed with caution. Violent reactions can cause explosions or burns. Hydrogen gas is flammable. Always wear eye protection and gloves. Adequate ventilation is crucial to prevent hydrogen buildup. Consult safety data sheets for specific metals.",
