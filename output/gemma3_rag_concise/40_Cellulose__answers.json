      "question": "Cellulose is described as providing structural support for plants. Discuss how its structure contributes to this function and compare its occurrence in various natural sources.",
      "answer": "Cellulose's structural support stems from its linear, polysaccharide structure composed of glucose units linked by beta-glycosidic bonds. These bonds form strong, rigid microfibrils within plant cell walls, providing tensile strength.\n\nOccurrence: Abundant in plant cell walls. Major sources include wood (trees), cotton (seed fibers), flax (stem fibers), hemp (stem fibers), and grasses. The specific cellulose content and crystalinity vary between sources, influencing material properties.",
