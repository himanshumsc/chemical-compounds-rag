      "question": "Describe the different methods used to prepare Magnesium Oxide and how they affect its chemical reactivity.",
      "answer": "Magnesium oxide (MgO) preparation methods significantly impact reactivity. It's typically made by calcining (heating) magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide. Calcination produces MgO with higher purity and surface area, leading to increased reactivity. Alternatively, direct reaction of magnesium with oxygen yields MgO. The particle size and crystalline structure, influenced by the method, also affect reactivity - smaller particles and amorphous structures are generally more reactive.\n\n\n\n(Character count: 317)",
