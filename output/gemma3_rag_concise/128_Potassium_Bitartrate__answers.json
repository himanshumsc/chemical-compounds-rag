      "answer": "Based on the provided information, the solubility section for each compound lists solvents in which it will dissolve well (\"soluble\"), to a slight extent (\"slightly soluble\"), or not at all (\"insoluble\"). Source 2 states that water is the most common solvent for inorganic compounds. Unfortunately, the database does not specify the solubility of Potassium Bitartrate (629) in specific solvents.",
