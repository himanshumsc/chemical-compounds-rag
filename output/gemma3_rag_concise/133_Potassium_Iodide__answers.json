      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of Potassium Iodide?",
      "answer": "Potassium Iodide: Chemical formula is KI. Molecular weight is not explicitly provided, but its listing with a number (651) in Source 1 suggests this might be its atomic number or a related identifier.",

      "question": "Describe the process of how Potassium Iodide can be made using iodine and potassium hydroxide.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't detail the synthesis of Potassium Iodide (KI). However, it mentions Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) reacting with a solution, precipitating aluminum hydroxide. This suggests a similar process *could* be applied: reacting iodine (I₂) with Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) in solution. As the solution cools, Potassium Iodide might settle out as a precipitate, which can then be dried.",

      "question": "Explain how Potassium Iodide acts as a protective agent against radiation exposure.",
      "answer": "Potassium Iodide (KI) protects against radiation exposure by flooding the thyroid gland with stable iodine. This prevents the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine, which can cause thyroid cancer. It's a preventative measure, not a treatment for radiation sickness.",
