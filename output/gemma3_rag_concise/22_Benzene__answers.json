      "question": "Explain why benzene's chemical structure was considered a mystery and how Friedrich August Kekulé contributed to understanding it.",
      "answer": "The chemical structure of benzene (C6H6) was a mystery due to its unusual stability and seemingly impossible bonding arrangement. Friedrich August Kekulé famously solved this in 1865. He had a dream of snakes chasing their tails, which inspired him to propose a cyclic structure for benzene, with alternating single and double bonds. This explained benzene's stability and properties.",
