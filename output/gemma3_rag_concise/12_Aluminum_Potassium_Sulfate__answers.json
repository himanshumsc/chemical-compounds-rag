      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of aluminum potassium sulfate and how it changes with temperature.",
      "answer": "Aluminum potassium sulfate's solubility isn't directly detailed in the provided sources. However, aluminum fluoride (AlF3) is \"slightly soluble in cold water, soluble in hot water,\" and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is \"slowly soluble in basic solutions.\" Potassium salts generally exhibit good water solubility. Therefore, aluminum potassium sulfate is likely to be moderately soluble, with solubility increasing with higher temperatures.",
