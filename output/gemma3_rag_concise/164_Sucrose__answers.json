      "question": "Explain why sucrose is classified as a disaccharide and how this relates to its chemical structure.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly define sucrose or disaccharides. However, it *does* define **carbohydrates** as \"organic compounds composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which are used by the body as food.\" Source 1 defines **monosaccharides** as simple sugars made of three to nine carbon atoms. Combining these definitions, a disaccharide would logically be a carbohydrate composed of two monosaccharides.\n\n\n\nTherefore, sucrose is classified as a disaccharide because it consists of two monosaccharide units linked together. This relates to its chemical structure: it's essentially two simple sugars joined as one larger molecule.",

It defines various chemical terms and provides details about acetic acid, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), and other compounds, but lacks information relevant to sucrose decomposition and its physical property changes.",
