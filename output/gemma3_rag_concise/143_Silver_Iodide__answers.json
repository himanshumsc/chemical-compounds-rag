      "question": "Describe the chemical reaction used to synthesize Silver Iodide from silver nitrate and sodium iodide. Why is ruby red light used during this process?",
      "answer": "The synthesis involves reacting silver nitrate (AgNO₃) with sodium iodide (NaI). A precipitate of silver iodide (AgI) forms. The reaction is: AgNO₃ + NaI → AgI↓ + NaNO₃.\n\nThe provided text doesn’t explain why ruby red light is used. It focuses on aluminum hydroxide synthesis, not silver iodide.",
