      "question": "Explain why TNT is considered a relatively safe explosive to handle compared to other explosives.",
      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly state that TNT is a *safe* explosive to handle compared to others. However, it does mention that Amatol, a TNT substitute, is \"often substituted for TNT in ordnance,\" and Baratol explodes more slowly than pure TNT. This suggests TNT may be preferred due to its slower explosion rate, potentially making it somewhat easier to handle than faster-acting explosives. It’s also noted that TNT's hazards primarily concern those involved in its manufacture/use, implying lower risk for general exposure.",

It mentions TNT is used in ordnance (often substituted for TNT), produces a yellow tint in dyes, and poses health hazards like respiratory problems. It does not, however, explain how solubility plays a role.",
