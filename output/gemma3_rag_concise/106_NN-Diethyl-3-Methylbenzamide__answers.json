      "question": "Explain the process by which N,N-Diethyl-3-Methylbenzamide (DEET) repels insects and discuss its safety considerations.",
      "answer": "DEET's insect-repelling mechanism isn't fully understood. It's believed to interfere with insects' ability to smell, masking human scents and disrupting their tracking abilities. It doesn't kill insects.\n\nSafety: DEET is generally safe when used as directed. Concerns exist regarding skin irritation/allergic reactions and potential neurotoxicity with excessive or prolonged exposure, especially in children. Use sparingly and avoid contact with eyes/mouth.",
