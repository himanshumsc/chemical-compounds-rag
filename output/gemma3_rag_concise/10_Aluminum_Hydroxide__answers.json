      "question": "Explain how aluminum hydroxide is used in medical applications and describe its effectiveness.",
      "answer": "Aluminum hydroxide is used medicinally as an antacid. It's a key ingredient in products like Maalox, Mylanta, and Gelusil, and is used to treat upset stomach, acid indigestion, and related symptoms. It neutralizes stomach acid. Its effectiveness stems from its ability to react with hydrochloric acid (stomach acid), forming aluminum chloride and water, thus raising the pH of the stomach contents.",

      "question": "Discuss the industrial production process of aluminum hydroxide from bauxite, including the role of sodium hydroxide.",
      "answer": "Aluminum hydroxide is produced by washing bauxite, a rocky material, with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This process extracts aluminum from the bauxite. The resulting aluminum oxide is then converted to aluminum hydroxide.",
