      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **carbon monoxide (CO)**. It consists of carbon and oxygen atoms. It's a toxic, odorless gas produced via partial oxidation of hydrocarbons or from natural gas/coal. Historically, it was mistaken for hydrogen.",

      "answer": "According to Source 4, carbon monoxide (CO) is used in the production of acetic acid. A common method involves heating synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and hydrogen [H2]) over a catalyst of copper metal mixed with zinc oxide to make methanol (CH3OH), which is then treated with CO to produce acetic acid.",
