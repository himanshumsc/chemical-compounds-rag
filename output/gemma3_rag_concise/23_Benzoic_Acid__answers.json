      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly detail the solubility properties or physical state of benzoic acid. However, it does mention that \"Solubility is an important property because most chemical reactions occur only when the reactants are dissolved. The most common solvent for organic compounds are the so-called organic solvents, which include alcohol, ether, acetone, and benzene.\" This implies benzoic acid, being an organic compound, would likely be soluble in these organic solvents.",
