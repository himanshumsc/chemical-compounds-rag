      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **Nitrous Oxide**. It's a gas used as an anesthetic and recreational drug. It contains nitrogen and oxygen atoms linked by a triple bond. It provides a sense of relaxation and pain relief.",

      "question": "Explain the solubility properties of Nitrous Oxide and its implications for usage.",
      "answer": "Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) is a gas at room temperature, exhibiting very low solubility in water. This low solubility is crucial for its applications. In anesthesia, it allows for rapid induction and relatively quick recovery as it readily escapes the body. Its gaseous state and limited water solubility also make it suitable for use as a propellant, as it easily diffuses.",
