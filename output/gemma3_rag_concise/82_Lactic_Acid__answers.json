      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **lactic acid**. It's produced during exercise when oxygen is scarce, a byproduct of glucose metabolism. It's a common compound, produced by yeast, and around 30 million kilograms are produced annually.",
