      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **Isoprene**. It's a hydrocarbon (carbon & hydrogen) and a polymer consisting of long chains. It's a key component of natural rubber. It's produced by breaking down refined petroleum via cracking.",

      "question": "Explain why isoprene is classified as an alkadiene and as a member of the terpene family.",
      "answer": "Isoprene is classified as an alkadiene because it's an alkene with two double bonds. It's also a terpene because it's a five-carbon isoprene unit that serves as a building block for terpenes, a large class of natural products.",
