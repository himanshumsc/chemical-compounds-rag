      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Polysiloxane. It's a silicone-like material, chemically inert and resistant to heat. Composed of silicon, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. A polymer with repeating units.",

      "question": "What elements are always present in the structure of polysiloxane, and which elements are almost always present?",
      "answer": "Polysiloxanes *always* contain Silicon (Si) and Oxygen (O). Hydrogen (H) is *almost always* present, along with Carbon (C) as side groups.",

      "question": "Explain the structural difference between a linear and a cyclic polysiloxane molecule.",
      "answer": "Linear polysiloxanes have a chain-like structure with repeating siloxane (-Si-O-) units linked in a straight line. Cyclic polysiloxanes are the same repeating units, but they form a closed ring. The key difference is the presence or absence of free ends; linear molecules have them, while cyclic molecules do not.",

It discusses aluminum fluoride, acetylene, acetic acid, and defines several chemical terms. Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on this data.",
