      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)​.**. It's red atoms are oxygen and yellow is sulfur. It's a byproduct of sulfur combustion & smelting. Used in chemical production (45% of use) and potential hazards exist.",
