      "question": "What is the chemical formula of Luminol and which elements does it contain?",
      "answer": "I apologize, but Luminol is not present in the provided chemical compounds database. Therefore, I cannot provide its chemical formula or the elements it contains based on this information.",

      "question": "Explain the phenomenon that occurs when luminol is combined with hydrogen peroxide and how it relates to forensic science.",
      "answer": "Luminol reacts with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a catalyst (like iron) to produce chemiluminescence – light emitted from a chemical reaction. Forensic scientists use this reaction to detect trace amounts of blood, as blood contains iron. The reaction creates a blue glow, making otherwise invisible bloodstains visible.",

      "question": "Discuss why the boiling point of Luminol is listed as 'not applicable' and what this indicates about its stability at high temperatures.",
      "answer": "The provided text does not mention Luminol or its boiling point. It primarily defines chemical terms and provides information about acetic acid and mustard gas. Therefore, it’s impossible to answer the question regarding Luminol's boiling point and stability based on this source material.",
