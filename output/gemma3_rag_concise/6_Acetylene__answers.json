      "question": "Explain why acetylene is highly flammable and how this property is utilized.",
      "answer": "Acetylene is highly flammable due to its chemical structure. It readily reacts with oxygen, producing a very hot flame (3,000-3,500°C). This property is utilized in oxyacetylene torches for cutting and welding metals, especially in cold climates or underwater. However, acetylene's flammability also presents a hazard, requiring careful handling and preventing contact with certain metals (copper, silver) to avoid explosive acetylides.",

      "question": "Describe the historical development in the production of Acetylene, including the roles of calcium carbide and the BASF process.",
      "answer": "Historically, acetylene production initially relied on the fermentation of materials containing sugar/carbohydrates, but this was inefficient. The modern industrial process involves reacting calcium carbide with water. Source 2 mentions \"Acetylene Properties, Purity and Packaging\" and links to resources detailing acetylene. The BASF process (not directly detailed in these sources) is known as a modern route, but the Carbide method remained significant for a long time, using calcium carbide.",
