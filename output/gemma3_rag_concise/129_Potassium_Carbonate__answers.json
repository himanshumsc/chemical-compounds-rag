      "answer": "Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is used in agriculture as a potassium source, providing nutrients for plant growth. Industrially, it’s a flux in glassmaking, a pH adjuster, and a chemical intermediate.\n\n**Hazards:** Potassium carbonate is caustic; contact can cause skin and eye irritation. Inhalation may irritate the respiratory tract. Safety precautions are needed when handling.",
