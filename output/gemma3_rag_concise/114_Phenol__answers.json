      "answer": "While the provided sources don't detail the discovery of phenol, they do highlight acetaminophen (a derivative) and its history. Acetaminophen (derived from p-aminophenol) was re-discovered and synthesized in 1873, but its medicinal qualities weren't recognized for 20 years, and it wasn't commonly used until 1949, eventually becoming the second most popular analgesic globally after aspirin. The provided context doesn’t speak to the early history or discovery of phenol itself.",
