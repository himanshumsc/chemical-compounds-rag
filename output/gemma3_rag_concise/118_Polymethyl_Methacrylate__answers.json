      "question": "Explain why Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) is preferred over glass for certain applications.",
      "answer": "PMMA is preferred over glass for some applications due to its lighter weight and greater impact resistance. Source 1 states PMMA was first synthesized in 1928, implying its development was driven by a need for alternatives to glass. While the provided text doesn't explicitly detail *which* applications, the properties suggest uses where weight and durability are crucial.",
