      "question": "Explain the concept of isomers in the context of butyl mercaptan and name its three isomers.",
      "answer": "Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. Butyl mercaptan (C₄H₁₀S) has several isomers. Three examples include:\n\n1. **n-Butyl Mercaptan:** CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂SH\n2. **sec-Butyl Mercaptan:** CH₃CH(SH)CH₂CH₃\n3. **isobutyl mercaptan:** (CH₃)₂CHCH₂SH\n\n\n\nThese isomers differ in how the sulfur atom is positioned relative to the carbon chain.",
