      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly mention Ethyl Acetate. However, it *does* discuss solubility and solvents in general. Acetone is listed as a common organic solvent, implying good solubility for organic compounds.\n\nSolubility is crucial: most reactions require reactants to be dissolved. Acetone (and likely Ethyl Acetate, being a related organic solvent) dissolves organic compounds well. This facilitates industrial reactions utilizing these compounds.\n\n\n\n**Character Count:** 235",
