      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), commonly known as Teflon. It has the lowest coefficient of friction, is non-stick, and was discovered by accident. It's a polymer made of repeating units.",

      "answer": "The provided text does not contain information about Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Therefore, it cannot answer the user's question regarding its boiling point.\n\n\n\nHowever, generally, PTFE (Teflon) doesn't have a defined boiling point because it decomposes before it reaches a liquid state. The strong carbon-fluorine bonds require extreme temperatures to break, and instead of melting or boiling, the material breaks down chemically.",
