      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **methanol** (also known as wood alcohol). It's a simple organic compound with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It's used in producing chemicals & as a fuel additive. Consumption can be harmful.",

It details acetic acid production via methanol and CO, and mentions acetic acid's uses in plastics and as a deicer (CMA). It also describes historical methods using fermentation. No information is provided regarding MTBE or environmental issues related to methanol's role in its production.",
