      "answer": "The provided text doesn't detail Amoxicillin's solubility. It mentions solubility generally, noting that most chemical reactions require reactants to be dissolved, with water common for inorganic compounds and organic solvents (alcohol, ether, acetone, benzene) for organic compounds. Solubility information for individual compounds, including Amoxicillin, is listed separately. Pharmaceutical application heavily relies on solubility for absorption and delivery – information absent here.",
