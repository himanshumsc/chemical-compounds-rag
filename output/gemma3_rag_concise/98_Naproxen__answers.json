      "question": "Why is Naproxen classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and what are its primary uses?",
      "answer": "While Naproxen isn't directly mentioned in the provided text, the information on Ibuprofen and Aspirin explains the broader NSAID class.\n\nNSAIDs like Ibuprofen work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Prostaglandins cause pain and inflammation. Therefore, NSAIDs reduce pain and swelling.\n\nIbuprofen is effective for menstrual cramps, arthritis, headaches, injuries, surgery-related pain, and discomfort from influenza/gout. Aspirin similarly reduces pain, fever, and inflammation and protects against heart attack/stroke.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the solubility characteristics of Naproxen and explain how these properties might influence its formulation as a pharmaceutical product.",
      "answer": "Ibuprofen (mentioned in Source 5) is slightly soluble in water and soluble in most organic solvents. This solubility influences pharmaceutical formulation. Limited water solubility may necessitate strategies like salt formation or complexation to improve dissolution and bioavailability. Organic solvents are used in manufacturing processes.\n\n\n\n**Please note:** The user asked about *Naproxen*, but it is not mentioned in the provided text. The information provided pertains to *Ibuprofen* only.",
