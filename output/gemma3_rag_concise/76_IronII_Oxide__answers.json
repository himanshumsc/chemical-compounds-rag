      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Iron(II) oxide (FeO). It's an inorganic oxide, represented by iron and oxygen. Inhalation of fumes/dust is hazardous, potentially causing siderosis. It's used in steel production and as a catalyst. Red atom is iron, gray stick is double bond.",

      "answer": "Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain specific information about the solubility properties of Iron(II) Oxide or its reactions with other compounds. It does, however, explain the \"Solubility\" section in the book, stating it lists if a compound is \"soluble,\" \"slightly soluble,\" or \"insoluble\" in various solvents like water, alcohol, ether, acetone, and benzene. It also mentions that most chemical reactions require reactants to be dissolved.",
