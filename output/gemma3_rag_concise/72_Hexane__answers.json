      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Hexane. It's a liquid with a low boiling point, used as a solvent. Potential hazards include inhalation causing numbness, weakness, and potentially paralysis. It readily vaporizes and ignites.",

      "question": "Explain why hexane is considered a saturated hydrocarbon and what implications this has for its chemical structure.",
      "answer": "Based on Source 2, hexane is a **hydrocarbon**, defined as a compound consisting *only* of carbon and hydrogen. This structure, with single bonds between carbon atoms, classifies it as a **saturated hydrocarbon**.\n\nThe saturation implies a stable structure; it cannot readily undergo addition reactions.  Unlike unsaturated hydrocarbons (containing double or triple bonds), hexane’s carbon-carbon bonds are already \"full\" with hydrogen atoms. This affects its reactivity – it's less prone to addition and more likely to undergo substitution reactions.",

      "question": "Describe the process by which hexane is obtained from petroleum and explain why its low boiling point is significant in this process.",
      "answer": "Hexane is obtained from petroleum through fractional distillation. Petroleum is heated, and components separate based on boiling points. Hexane's low boiling point (353, per Source 1) allows it to vaporize and be collected at a lower temperature than heavier components, facilitating its separation and purification.",
