      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "The image depicts **propane** (C3H8). It's a hydrocarbon, consisting of carbon and hydrogen. Roughly half of propane in the US comes from petroleum and half from natural gas.",

      "answer": "The provided text doesn't explicitly state propane's solubility. However, it mentions that organic compounds generally dissolve well in organic solvents like alcohol, ether, acetone, and benzene. Since propane is an organic compound, it would likely be soluble in these types of solvents. Water is the common solvent for inorganic compounds, not organic ones.",
