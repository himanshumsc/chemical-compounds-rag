      "question": "What is the chemical formula and molecular weight of glycerol?",
      "answer": "Glycerol's chemical formula is C3H8O3. Molecular weight is not explicitly stated, but its presence in the database with an entry number (349) suggests it's a known compound.",

      "question": "Why is glycerol classified as a trihydric alcohol, and what are its solubility properties?",
      "answer": "Glycerol is a trihydric alcohol because its molecular structure contains three hydroxyl (-OH) groups attached to a glycerol backbone. This triol structure dictates its solubility. Glycerol is highly soluble in water due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. It is also miscible with many organic solvents.",

It discusses acetic acid and acetaminophen, detailing their manufacture and uses but makes no mention of glycerol or its role in the soap industry. Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on the given context.",
