      "question": "Explain why hydrogen peroxide is considered a strong oxidizing agent in its applications.",
      "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent because it readily donates oxygen atoms in chemical reactions. This property is crucial in its applications as a stabilizer (preventing breakdown), a raw material in pharmaceutical and photographic chemical production, and in azo dye manufacturing. The ability to oxidize other substances is fundamental to these roles.",
