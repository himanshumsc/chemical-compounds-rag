      "question": "Explain the solubility and reactivity of cyanoacrylate with water.",
      "answer": "Cyanoacrylate's solubility and reactivity with water are key to its adhesive properties. It's practically insoluble in water initially. However, trace amounts of water trigger rapid polymerization. Water molecules react with the cyanoacrylate, initiating a chain reaction that forms a strong, durable bond. This is why cyanoacrylate adhesives require only slight moisture to cure.",
