      "question": "Look at the molecular structure diagram in the image. What chemical compound is shown, and what are its key properties?",
      "answer": "Copper(I) oxide. Red atoms are oxygen, turquoise are copper. It's used as a pigment, antifouling agent, and in photoelectric cells. It prevents the growth of barnacles & fungi.",

      "question": "Describe the stability and transformation behavior of Copper(I) Oxide in different air conditions.",
      "answer": "Copper(I) Oxide (Cu₂O) is unstable in air. In moist air, it readily oxidizes to Copper(II) Oxide (CuO). This transformation is accelerated by higher temperatures and humidity. Dry air provides some stability, but prolonged exposure will still lead to oxidation. The product is typically a reddish-brown CuO layer on the Cu₂O surface.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the process and precautions involved in synthesizing Copper(I) Oxide industrially from copper metal.",
      "answer": "Industrial synthesis of Copper(I) Oxide (Cu₂O) typically involves heating copper metal in a controlled oxygen atmosphere at temperatures around 400-800°C. This oxidizes the copper surface, forming a layer of Cu₂O.\n\nPrecautions:\n\n*   **Oxygen control:** Precise oxygen flow is crucial; too much leads to CuO (Copper(II) Oxide).\n*   **Temperature regulation:** Maintaining the correct temperature range is vital for selective Cu₂O formation.\n*   **Safety:** High temperatures and oxygen require proper ventilation and fire safety measures.",
