    {
      "question": "Why is Potassium Nitrate considered an oxidizing agent, and what role does it play in gunpowder?",
      "answer": "Potassium nitrate (KNO₃) is an oxidizing agent because it readily provides oxygen during chemical reactions. In gunpowder, it acts as the oxidizer. The carbon and sulfur in gunpowder react with the oxygen released by the potassium nitrate upon ignition, producing hot gases that create an explosion. It’s crucial for gunpowder's rapid combustion.",
